<p class="halftitle">A YEAR AT THE SHORE.</p>




<h2 class="nobreak">I.<br />

JANUARY.</h2>


<p>How grandly those heavy waves are rolling in upon
this long shingle-beach! Onward they come, with an
even deliberate march that tells of power, out of that
lowering sky that broods over the southern horizon;
onward they come, onward! onward!&mdash;each following
its precursor in serried ranks, ever coming nearer and
nearer, ever looming larger and larger, like the resistless
legions of a great invading army, sternly proud in its
conscious strength; and ever and anon, as one and
another dark billow breaks in a crest of foam, we may
fancy we see the standards and ensigns of the threatening
host waving here and there above the mass.</p>

<p>Still they drive in; and each in turn curls over its
green head, and rushes up the sloping beach in a long-drawn
sheet of the purest, whitest foam. The drifted
snow itself is not more purely, spotlessly white than is
that sheet of foaming water. How it seethes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
sparkles! how it boils and bubbles! how it rings and
hisses! The wind sings shrilly out of the driving
clouds, now sinking to a moan, now rising to a roar;
but we cannot hear it, for its tones are drowned in the
ceaseless rushing of the mighty waves upon the beach
and the rattle of the recoiling pebbles. Along the
curvature of the shore the shrill hoarse voice runs,
becoming softer and mellower as it recedes; while the
echo of the bounding cliffs confines and repeats it, and
mingles it with the succeeding ones, till all are blended
on the ear in one deafening roar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LOOK-OUT.</div>

<p>But let us climb these slippery rocks, and picking
our way cautiously over yonder craggy ledges, leaping
the chasms that yawn between and reveal the hissing
waters below, let us strive to attain the vantage-ground
of that ridge that we see some fifty feet above the beach.
It is perilous work, this scrambling over rocks, alternately
slimy with treacherous sea-weed, and bristling
with sharp needle-points of honey-combed limestone;
now climbing a precipice, with the hands clutching
these same rough points, and the toes finding a precarious
hold in their interstices; now descending to a
ledge awfully overhung; now creeping along a narrow
shelf, by working each foot on, a few inches at a time;
while the fingers nervously cling to the stony precipice,
and the mind strives to forget the rugged depths below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and what would happen if&mdash;(ah! that “if!” let us cast
it to the winds): another long stride across a gulf, a
bound upward, and here we are.</p>

<p>Yes, here we stand, on the bluff, looking out to seaward
in the very eye of the wind. We might have
supposed it a tolerably smooth slope of stone when we
looked at the point from the sea, or from the various
parts of the shore whence we can see this promontory.
But very different is it on a close acquaintance. It is a
wilderness of craggy points and huge castellated masses
of compact limestone marble, piled one on another in
the wildest and most magnificent confusion. We have
secured a comfortable berth, where, wedged in between
two of these masses, we can without danger lean on
one breast-high, and gaze over it down upon the very
theatre of the elemental war. Is not this a sight worth
the toil and trouble and peril of the ascent? The rock
below is fringed with great insular peaks and blocks,
bristling up amidst the sea, of various sizes and of the
most fantastic and singular forms, which the sea at
high-water would mostly cover; though now the far-receding
tide exposes their horrid points, and the brown
leprous coating of barnacles with which their lower
sides are covered is broadly seen between the swelling
seas.</p>

<p>Heavily rolls in the long deep swell of the ocean from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the south-west; and as it approaches with its huge undulations
driven up into foaming crests before the howling
gale, each mighty wave breasts up against these rocks,
as when an army of veteran legions assaults an impregnable
fortress. Impregnable indeed! for having spent
its fury in a rising wall of mingled water and foam, it
shoots up perpendicularly to an immense elevation, as
if it would scale the heights it could not overthrow,
only to lie the next moment a broken ruin of water,
murmuring and shrieking in the moats below. The
insular peaks and blocks receive the incoming surge in
an overwhelming flood, which, immediately, as the spent
wave recedes, pours off through the interstices in a
hundred beautiful jets and cascades; while in the
narrow straits and passages the rushing sea boils and
whirls about in curling sheets of snowy whiteness,
curdling the surface; or, where it breaks away, of the
most delicate pea-green hue, the tint produced by the
bubbles seen through the water as they crowd to the
air from the depths where they were formed,&mdash;the evidence
of the unseen combat fiercely raging between earth
and sea far below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-GULLS.</div>

<p>The shrieking gusts, as the gale rises yet higher and
more furious, whip off the crests of the breaking billows,
and bear the spray like a shower of salt sleet to the
height where we stand; while the foam, as it forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and accumulates around the base of the headland, is
seized by the same power in broad masses, and carried
against the sides of the projecting rocks; flying hither
and thither like fleeces of wool, and adhering like so
much mortar to the face of the precipice, till it covers
great spaces, to the height of many fathoms above the
highest range of the tide. The gulls flit wailing through
the storm, now breasting the wind, and beating the air
with their long wings as they make slow headway;
then, yielding the vain essay, they turn and are whirled
away, till, recovering themselves, they come up again
with a sweep, only again to be discomfited. Their
white forms, now seen against the leaden-grey sky, now
lost amidst the snowy foam, then coming into strong
relief against the black rocks; their piping screams,
now sounding close against the ear, then blending
with the sounds of the elements, combine to add a
wildness to the scene which was already sufficiently
savage.</p>

<p>But the spring-tide is nearly at its lowest; a rocky
path leads down from our eminence to a recess in the
precipice, whence in these conditions access may be
obtained to a sea-cavern, that we may possibly find
entertainment in exploring.</p>

<p>We reluctantly turn our backs upon the magnificent
battle of sea and land, and following this sheep-track,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
scramble down, holding fast by the tufts of thrift, round
and soft and yielding, but sufficiently firm to present
some resistance, or by the tussocks of wiry grass, till
we leap down on the great piled masses of marble that
past ages have thrown from the cliffs upon the beach.
Among these we find many basins and pools of still
water, for we are in a deep recess of the promontory,
whose shelter renders us almost unconscious of the fury
of the winter wind without; and the masses of rock
that lie piled about so curb and break the force of the
incoming sea, that it percolates rather than rushes into
these secluded nooks. Tall walls of stone, too, shut out
much of the light of day; and as to the sun, only his
most slant evening rays ever reach this spot: it is
enshrouded in an obscurity which is most congenial to
both the plants and the animals which resort to our
shores; and here, doubtless, though the season is still
midwinter, we shall find our searchings rewarded by
not a few of those creatures, beautiful and wondrous, in
which the devout naturalist delights to trace the handiwork
of the God of glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOP-SHELL.</div>

<p>At the very first glance into this little rock-hollow,
all fringed with crimson and purple weed, lined with
scales of lilac coralline, and partly shadowed by the
olive fronds of the leathery tangle, we discern many
forms of animal life. Here, for instance, is a fine hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>some
shelled mollusk, the Purple-spotted Top.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Before
we take him up, let us notice for a moment with what
an easy even movement he glides along over the leaves
of the sea-weed, now over the stony projections of the
pool, now on the broad weeds again. On lifting the
shell, we find that the fine, fleshy, apricot-coloured
animal clings with considerable force to the weed; and
on transferring it to a glass bottle, we get a better sight
of the organ by which it maintains both its stability
and its movements. The under-surface of the creature,
then, forms a long, nearly parallel-sided sole, abruptly
pointed behind, where it stretches to a considerable distance
in the rear of the shell, and bounded in front by
a slightly-thickened transverse rim, a little arched, and
projecting on each side. This organ is the foot, and it
is composed of muscular fibres elaborately interwoven,
much as in the human tongue, whereby great versatility
and power of motion are communicated to it; indeed,
when in motion, it strongly reminds one of the human
tongue.</p>

DOG-WHELK. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PELICAN’S FOOT. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TOP. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; COWRY.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The sensitive and muscular foot of our captive has
already taken hold of the glass side of its prison, and
it is now smoothly mounting up it. With a lens you
may see that though it is one undivided area, yet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the arrangement of its muscles, it is separated into two
portions by a line which runs down the middle; and
that these two sides move alternately. The muscles of
the right half, for example, are moved a little onward,
and take a fresh hold of the ground, while those of the
left remain clinging; then the right half clings, while
the left relaxes and advances a little beyond the right,
and again clings, when the right makes its forward
move. So that the effect is exactly that of two feet
advancing by alternate steps; and if your own two
feet were enclosed in one elastic stocking, your own
progress would appear very much like that of the
<i>Trochus</i>. Indeed, some shell-fishes not distantly allied
to this, as the pretty little Pheasant-shell,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which I
occasionally find among these rocks, really have the
foot divided into two distinct and separate halves, in
which this alternate motion is, of course, more obvious.</p>

<p>Looked at from above, we discern that this foot
thickens towards the middle, where it is overlapped
by a broad wing-like expansion on each side. This,
for manifest reasons, is known by the name of the
cloak or mantle. In all cases it performs important
offices in the economy of the animal, as I shall presently
describe; and in this instance we see it is
adorned along its edges with certain lappets and long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
fleshy taper threads (called <i>cirri</i>), which wave vivaciously
to and fro as the creature crawls. These are
probably the seats of a delicate sense; perhaps receiving
impressions analogous to those of touch, from the
strokes they continually make on the surrounding fluid.</p>

<p>In front we see a distinct head, with a broad flat
muzzle not altogether unlike that of an ox. On each
side of the back part of this head, there is another long
taper thread: these are called tentacles, but neither in
form nor in structure can we discern any difference between
these and the <i>cirri</i> that fringe the mantle. In
all probability they are alike organs of a highly delicate
sense of touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TOP’S EYES.</div>

<p>Immediately behind each of these head-tentacles you
see a little wart, which has a black bead set as it were
in its substance. You have often, doubtless, observed
the similar black points that are placed at the tips of
the upper pair of the horns (tentacles) of the common
garden snail; and I daresay, when a child, you have
amused yourself by touching them, and noticing how
instantaneously the sensitive creature would roll them
in, so to speak, concealing them far in the interior of
the inturned horns. And every child is taught that
these black spots are the snail’s <i>eyes</i>; and so, indeed,
they are; and these spots on our Top’s warts are its
eyes too, notwithstanding that some learned naturalists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
apparently from the mere love of paradox, have affected
to doubt the fact that such is their function. If you
could dissect out one of these points, and submit it to
careful examination with a good microscope, you would
find all the parts essential to an organ of vision; there
is a sclerotic coat, a distinct little pupil and iris, a
cornea in front, and a dark pigment layer within, with
vitreous and aqueous humours, and even a crystalline
lens for the condensation of the rays of light. Minute
these parts are, to be sure, but not less exquisitely
finished for that. Indeed, the more skill they require
in the demonstrator, the more they reflect the inimitable
skill of the Creator. Swammerdam, the Dutch
physiologist, who so beautifully showed the structure of
the snail’s eye, seems to have feared the doubts of his
conclusions that would ensue from the difficulty of repeating
his investigations. “But who will credit this?”
he says; “for does it not seem impossible that on a
point not larger than the nib of the pen with which I
write, such exquisite art and so many miracles should
be displayed?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPIRAL SHELLS.</div>

<p>Now, leaving the animal, though we might devote a
few moments to the admiration of its rich colours,
adorned as is its deep yellow hue with lines and clouds
of deeper brown, let us look at the shell, the solid house
of stone, which our friend Trochus has himself built up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to cover his head in the hour of danger. How well has
he combined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utile cum dulci</i>!&mdash;the comfortable with
the ornamental! Its general form is that of a cone of
much regularity, but with an oblique base, and perhaps
you may be surprised to learn that this conical form is
but the result of the winding of a very long cone upon
itself in a spire. But if you examine a dead shell with
care, you will see that it is so. Supposing you had a
very long and slender hollow cone of plastic material,
and, beginning with the acute point, you twined the
whole upon itself, descending in a spiral form, you
would have the representation of a turbinate shell,
which, by a little gentle pressure of the fingers, might
be moulded, without at all losing its essential character,
into the exact shape of our Trochus, in which the progress
of the spire can without difficulty be followed as
well by slight inequalities of surface as by the arrangement
of the colours.</p>

<p>It is one of our showy shells. This specimen before
us has for its ground colour a chaste, cool grey, occasionally
varied with tints of reddish buff, but most
conspicuously adorned with a series of large and regular
spots of purplish crimson running along the lower
angle of the spire from the base to the summit. Each
of these spots passes off into an oblique line above, the
repetition of which augments the beauty of the pattern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The interior of the shell has a glory of quite another
character. It is covered with a coat of nacre or pearl,
of exceedingly brilliant and rich lustre, and the presence
of this inward pearliness is quite characteristic of this
genus, and of most of the others belonging to the same
family, the <i>Turbinidæ</i>. Many of the fine large tropical
species are specially conspicuous for this adornment, as
I have seen in those that lie along the dazzling beach
of coral-sand in lovely Jamaica. The pearl of these
shells is used in the arts. De Montfort mentions a
necklace which he had seen, that was made out of the
nacred part of the shell of the <i>Turbo smaragdus</i>, and
which was <i>much more brilliant and beautiful</i> than any
of the finest orient pearls.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And Chenu observes:&mdash;“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
grandes espèces fournissent une fort belle nacre,
employée pour les ouvrages de marqueterie. Quelques
espèces ont reçu des noms sous lesquels les marchands
les distinguent: il y a le Burgau ou Nacré; la Veuve
Perlée, dont les tubercles extérieurs usés ressemblent à
des perles; la Bouche-d’Or, dont la nacre est d’un beau
jaune doré; la Bouche-d’Argent; le Perroquet, ou Turbo
Impérial,</span>” etc.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>At another time we may examine the structure of
shell, and inquire by what instruments and with what
materials the ingenious animal contrives to construct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
so strong and so elegant a dwelling. For the present,
however, as the month is January, we shall, if we sit
still longer, run the risk of “catching a cold,” if we
catch nothing else, though the wind <i>is</i> in the south,
and the temperature is so mild for the season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOG-WHELK.</div>

<p>Therefore, we will move about and pursue our researches
among the rocks and under the loose stones.
Well, we are rewarded with other specimens: here are
several neat little shells, with a lengthened spire, and
with a remarkably thickened lip. This is the little
Thick-lipped Dog-whelk,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a very common mollusk
with us under such stones as these at low water-mark.
And here is another species of the same genus, the
Netted Dog-whelk,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which is a much larger shell, being
nearly twice as long as the former, and marked with
close transverse furrows, which, crossing the longitudinal
ribs at right angles, give a peculiar reticulate
surface, on which the specific name is founded.</p>

<p>Comparing these shells with the <i>Trochus</i>, we see that
they have a deep notch cut in the front part, of which
no sign appears in the latter; and this mark, trivial as
it may seem, is an important indication of the habits of
the animal. The inhabitants of all shells which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
this notch are carnivorous, while those with simple lips
are herbivorous. The <i>Trochus</i> gnaws or rather rasps
away the tender growth of marine vegetation, or the
fronds of the grown <i>Algæ</i>, with its remarkable palate-ribbon,
all studded with reversed points, of which I may
find another opportunity to speak. The Dog-whelk, on
the other hand, acts the part of a cannibal ogre, feeding
on his simpler brethren of the bivalve shells; storming
their stony castles, in which they seem so secure, by
open violence.</p>

<p>Look at this old valve of a <i>Mactra</i>. Like hundreds
more that you may pick up at high water-mark, it is
perforated by a tiny hole near the hinge, so smooth and
so perfectly circular, that you would suppose a clever
artisan had been at work drilling the massive stony
shell with his steel wimble. No such thing: the Dog-whelk
has done it: this is the breach which he so
scientifically effected in the fortress; and hence he
sucked out the soft and juicy and savoury flesh of his
miserable victim.</p>

<p>In order to understand his plan of operations, let us
put down our captive, and see him crawl. He is not
long before he begins to march, on his broad oblong
foot, which, as you observe, is cream-coloured, elegantly
splashed and speckled with dark-brown. But before
he moves he thrusts out a long cylindrical proboscis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
from the front of his head, which he carries high aloft
and waves to and fro; and this organ, we see, fits into
the deep notch in front of the shell. This proboscis is
his drilling-wimble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOG-WHELK’S DRILL.</div>

<p>This organ is itself a study. Long as it is when extended,
it can be thoroughly drawn within the body;
and there it forms two fleshy cylinders, one within the
other, exactly like a stocking half turned on itself.
There are proper muscles attached to its walls, and to
the interior of the head, by extremities which are
branched in a fan-shape, so as greatly to strengthen
their insertions; and these, by contraction, draw the
one portion within the other. Then there is a broad
hoop of muscle, which, passing round the inner cylinder,
by contracting pushes it out, and lengthens it.
Within the interior of this latter there is a long narrow
ribbon of cartilage, which is armed with rows of sharp
flinty points, turned backwards; and this tongue or
palate, as it is variously called, is the Dog-whelk’s
weapon.</p>

<p>We cannot induce the Whelk to attack his prey just
when we please; but he has been detected in the operation,
and I will describe it. With his broad muscular
foot he secures a good hold of the bivalve, and having
selected his point of attack, in general near the hinge&mdash;a
selection which probably looks more at the superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of the meat within than at any peculiar facility in the
perforation&mdash;he brings the tip of his extended proboscis
to the point, so that the silicious teeth can act on the
shell. Hard as is the calcareous shell, it is not proof
against the flint; for, without any solvent excretion,
the aid of which some physiologists have been ready to
suppose, these glassy points, grating round and round
as on a pivot, soon wear away the substance, and
gradually bore the tiny aperture which exposes the
sapid morsel.</p>

<p>Continuing our researches, we find, deep in a rocky
pool under a tuft of weed, a shell of a peculiar form,
because of the enormous expansion of its outer lip. It
is known as the Pelican’s-foot,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> from the resemblance
which this lip with its diverging ribs bears to the webbed
toes of a water-fowl. This, too, is a carnivorous
species; and though it is somewhat rare to detect the
animal moving, even though kept alive in captivity,
yet by carefully examining this one in its deep pool,
before we disturb its equanimity, we can just see the
proboscis protruding from the wide square notch in the
shell, and discern that it is rather prettily coloured,
being marked with spots of opaque white on a rose-coloured
ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>This species is interesting from the changes of figure
which it undergoes in its progress from youth to maturity.
While young the shell is simple, with no trace of
the expanded lip; and it is only at mature age, and
rather suddenly, that the shell makes its remarkable
growth into these far-projecting points and angles, the
augmented thickness of which is, moreover, at least
equally conspicuous with the expanse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COWRY.</div>

<p>But far more remarkable changes take place in the
growth of the shell in a family of signal beauty, of
which I discern a specimen in yonder cavernous hollow.
The family I speak of is that of the Cowries;
and this individual represents the only species that is
indigenous to our seas&mdash;the little Furrowed Cowry.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Let us pause awhile to admire it, for it is one of the
very loveliest of our marine animals.</p>

<p>The shell itself is doubtless familiar to most of my
readers, for it is to be picked up on every sandy beach.
It varies in size from that of a split pea to that of a
large horsebean. It is elegantly marked all over with
transverse ridges. These ridges are porcellaneous white,
and the alternate furrows between are purplish, or
flesh-coloured. The larger specimens commonly display
three spots of dark brown, arranged lengthwise. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
probably few are aware how very elegant a creature it
is when tenanted by its living inhabitant, and crawling
at ease in clear water. The foot, on which it glides
with a slow but smooth motion over the surface of the
rock on which it habitually dwells, or, if you please, on
the bottom of the saucer of sea-water in which you are
examining it, is a broad expansion spreading out to
twice the superficies of the base of the shell. Above
this is the fleshy mantle, which is so turned up as
closely to invest the shell, conforming to its shape, and
even fitting into the grooves between the ridges. This
mantle can be protruded, at the will of the animal,
so far that the two sides meet along the top of the
shell, and completely cover it, or it can be completely
retracted within the wrinkled lips beneath; and it is
capable of all gradations of extension between these
limits. From the front of the shell protrudes the head,
armed with two straight and lengthened tentacles,
answering in function and appearance to the upper
pair of horns in a snail; except that the little
black points which constitute the visual organs are not
in this case placed at the tips, but on a little prominence
on the outside of the base of each tentacle. Above
and between these, which diverge at a considerable
angle, projects the proboscis, a rather thick fleshy tube,
formed by a flat lamina, with its edges bent round so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
as to meet along the under side. The interior of this
proboscis is lined with delicate cilia, by whose constant
vibrations a current of water is drawn into the tube
and poured over the surface of the gills, for the purpose
of respiration. This current may be readily perceived
by any one who will take the trouble to watch, with a
pocket-lens, a Cowry crawling along the side of a phial
filled with sea-water. By placing the vessel between
your eye and the light, and fixing your attention on the
front of the proboscis, you will presently perceive the
minute particles of floating matter (always held in suspension,
even in clear water) drawn in various directions
towards the tube, with a motion which increases
in velocity as they approach, and at length rapidly
sucked in, and disappearing one after another within.
It is an interesting sight to see, and one that cannot be
looked on without delight and admiration at this beautiful
contrivance of Divine Wisdom, for the incessant
breathing of the respiratory organs in water charged
with vivifying oxygen.</p>

<p>Let us look at the vivid hues of all these organs.
The foot, which expands to so great a length and
breadth behind the shell, is of a buff or pale orange
ground-colour, delicately striated with longitudinal undulating
veins of yellowish white. The mantle which
embraces the shell is of a pellucid olive, thickly mottled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and spotted with black, and studded with glands protruded
through its substance, of light yellow; and is
often edged with a narrow border of red. The proboscis
is vermilion-red, varying in brilliancy in different individuals.
The tentacles are of a paler tint of the
same colour, speckled with yellow.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the beauty of the animal which inhabits
this familiar and plain little shell,&mdash;a beauty of
which those who know it only in cabinets can hardly
form an idea; while, as the observer gazes on it placidly
gliding along, he cannot avoid an emotion of surprise
that such an amplitude of organs can be folded within
the narrow compass of the shell, and protruded through
so contracted an aperture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCALLOP.</div>

<p>You would scarcely recognise in this shell, or in the
Tiger Cowry, that one so often sees on chimney-pieces,
the model of an ordinary convolute spiral shell, such as
the snail or the whelk. But in infancy and youth the
Cowry is a shell manifestly of such a character, scarcely
to be distinguished from the Olives and Volutes; a
shell with a distinct spire, a long wide aperture, and a
thin-edged outer lip. But when the animal has arrived
at mature age, a sudden deposition of shelly matter
takes place on the lip, which is greatly thickened, and
which expands above so as to conceal the spire, bending
inward at the same time and approaching the inner lip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
so as to reduce the aperture to a very narrow line.
Finally, a thick coat of enamel, or glossy porcellaneous
lime, is spread over the entire surface of the shell, from
the narrow aperture to the back-line, which coat takes
the form of those transverse folds which are so characteristic
of the species and so elegant.</p>

<p>Here, clinging to the perpendicular wall of rock,
sheltered snugly by an overshadowing stone, which I
have just removed, is a lovely specimen of the Squin or
Scallop.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the ages of monkery, when men’s eyes
were more directed to the land where the blessed Lord
Jesus once sojourned than to the place where He now
is, and pilgrimage to an earthly country was more
valued than that to a heavenly, this shell affixed to the
hat was the accepted sign that the wearer had visited
Jerusalem; and received the homage of sanctity that
such a pilgrim claimed.</p>

SCALLOPS.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Some mystic connexion, some secret sympathy, was
assumed to exist between the scallop and St. James, the
brother of the Lord, first bishop of Jerusalem. What
it was appears to be irrecoverably lost in the darkness
of those very dark ages, and is doubtless not worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
hunting up. We may leave such puerilities, to consider
the impress of His divine hand which the All-wise
God has made on the shell of the mollusk that
inhabits it.</p>

<p>These bivalves have been called the “butterflies of
the sea,” as well on account of the vivid and varied
colours with which their broad wing-like valves are
painted, as of their agile fluttering and flying movements.
We frequently see them, especially for some
time after having been taken and put into an unfamiliar
scene, as our aquariums, shoot hither and thither
through the water, with irregular zigzag flights, accompanied
with fitful openings and closings of the valves.
These leaps and flights seem to have no determinate
object, except “the letting off the steam” of their exuberant
animal vivacity; but the creatures have the
power of directing their leap by a forcible ejection of
water from any given part of the compressed lips of the
mantle.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCALLOP’S EYES.</div>

<p>It is a very pretty sight to see a healthy Pecten in a
vessel of clear sea-water. The elegant valves are
opened to a considerable width, perhaps to half an
inch or more, and the entire aperture all round is filled
by a curtain, which drops from one to the other, perpendicularly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a little way within the margin. This is
the mantle, and it is generally painted with rich colours,
in irregular patterns, often of spots and marbled clouds
of black on a rich green ground, or pearly-green clouds
on flesh-colour&mdash;sometimes pale-yellow clouds on velvet-black;
but these hues have no perceptible relation
with those of the shell. Looking closely, you see that
the mantle is not single, but composed of two curtains,
whose edges meet in the middle. And now these are
slightly separating, and giving us a peep into the interior;
but the most notable thing we see is the array
of long white taper tentacles which proceed from each
edge, and wave to and fro in the clear water; while
another row of similar organs, but larger, is affixed to
each curtain along the line where it starts from the
shell. And along this same line, scattered between the
bases of the larger tentacles, there is a row (and a corresponding
one on the other curtain) of beads, which
seem to be turned out of the richest and most lustrous
gems. Even the unassisted eye is arrested by the flashing
brilliance, but with a powerful lens they look like
rubies set in sockets of sapphire, from which the light
blazes forth with incomparable brilliance. These are
the Pecten’s eyes, each of which possesses all the parts
requisite for perfect vision.</p>

<p>The valves vary much in colour. Some are pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
white; some white with a crimson line along the summit
of each radiating ridge; some rosy, crimson, or lilac; some
cream, straw-yellow, deep yellow; some dull brick-red,
dark purplish-red, or sienna-brown; some are marbled
with black on a red ground, making a very rich pattern.</p>

<p>The largest specimens, and those with greatest variety
in hue, are found in deep water, and for the most part
congregated in large numbers on some particular spot
of the sea-bottom, which is called a scallop-bed. Such
are found in Weymouth Bay, and in Torbay; and there
the shell-fish can be obtained in sufficient quantity for
the market. At Weymouth there is a considerable
business done in these delicacies, which is, however,
almost all in the hands of one dealer, from whom I have
collected some details of interest.</p>

<p>The ordinary trawlers avoid the scallop-beds, if possible,
because they are liable to have their nets torn by
them; the sharp valves doubtless catching and cutting
the meshes. But they often bring up many unintentionally,
and a naturalist would find a trawler’s refuse
a most productive field: for numbers of rare and valuable
zoophytes and other forms of life come up attached
to the shells, which might easily be saved, but are not:
the men “have no time, for they are so anxious to get
their craft into a berth, and then to take out the fish as
soon as the trawl is up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty bushels of scallops are sometimes taken at
once; but this is rare. The average produce of the
Weymouth trawlers is five bushels per week, which are
readily sold at twopence per hundred; about seven
hundred going to the bushel. The customers are
“mostly the genteels,” who eat the <i>morceaux</i> stewed
with flour or scolloped. The worthy woman who commands
the supply had had the trade in her hands for
twenty-eight years (in 1853); she had never heard
them called by any other name than “Squins,” though
she understood they were called Scallops in some places.
“Squin” is by some said to be a corruption of “Quin,”
after the actor and epicure of that name, who is reported
to have been fond of the delicate mollusk; but I much
doubt the derivation.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>As a proof of the tenacity of life possessed by this
species, a fisherman assured me that he once put a quantity
in a bag into a cupboard and forgot them, till, after
the lapse of a week, turning them out he found them alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SEA-CUCUMBER.</div>

<p>But now another object of interest claims attention:
for, in this cavern, closely squeezed in between the layers
of stone, I see the satiny-white skin of a glorious Sea-cucumber.
And now to get him out, there’s the rub.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
So firmly imbedded is he, so deeply ensconced, that no
pushing with fingers or sticks will avail; indeed, I can
but just touch his body with my finger-ends poked in
to the utmost. No; we must cut away the rock above
and below with the strong steel chisel, by means of
well-directed strokes of a heavy hammer. Slow work
it is, for the rock is awfully hard: the prize, however,
cannot escape, and the chief point of solicitude is not to
crush it in the process. At length a fortunate blow
splits off a slice of rock, which leaves the unhappy
skulker defenceless. Now I get my fingers gradually
behind him, and force him out, gently and tenderly;
sucker after sucker he is compelled to let go, and now
here he is in my hand, shrunken indeed, and squeezed
flat from his very shrinking in the close crevice, but
all unbroken and none the worse.</p>

<p>This is a much more sluggish creature than any of
the mollusks that we have been capturing: no sooner
are they put into water than they are active, and at
once display their attractions; this animal, on the
contrary, will be perhaps several days in your tank
before he will feel himself sufficiently at home to unfold
his splendid array of tentacles. But then it is indeed
a magnificent coronet of plumes wherewith the headless
king is adorned.</p>

<p>The Sea-cucumber soon finds himself a snug berth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
among the rock-work of the tank; pressing his body
between the pieces just as when we saw him first, but
taking care to leave space to protrude his front. Then
this part evolves, and a deep collar of dark purple is
seen, from which a ring of ten somewhat thick stems
arises, tapering to a point and arching outwards. These
are of a purplish-black hue, and are studded with short
branches set on in a spiral, which again branch and
branch again, each terminal point bearing a white
papilla; so that the whole constitutes a series of conical
aggregations of white dots clustering about the black
stems, something like pointed cauliflowers, and forming,
as they wave to and fro in the clear water, a very
charming spectacle.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

DOTTED SIPONCLE. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SEA-CUCUMBER.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The suckers, which, when the animal first came into
our possession, were apparent only as little warts,
arranged in five clustered rows down the angles of the
body, are now seen to be long tubes, each with an
adhering disk at its extremity, by which it anchors to
the surrounding stones. The mechanism of these
suckers does not importantly differ from that of the
same organs in the Star-fishes. Indeed, notwithstanding
the very wide diversity of form and appearance between
the two animals, the Cucumber and the Star are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
nearly allied as to belong to the same class, that
named <span class="smcap">Echinodermata</span>; the Sea-urchins, creatures
totally diverse in aspect from both, connecting the
forms together.</p>

<p>And this Cucumber, again, is connected with the
proper worms (<span class="smcap">Annellida</span>) by some obscure animals
which bear the name of Siponcles. Here is one which
may illustrate the form, the Dotted Siponcle.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It has
a cylindrical body, rounded and abruptly pointed behind,
which is of a light-brown hue, with a satiny gloss;
but the hue resolves itself under a powerful lens into a
freckling of pale dots, excessively numerous, on a brown
ground, and the lustre into a multitude of close-set
annular wrinkles. What is curious in the creature is
the protrusion and retraction of its trunk. From the
front end of the body we see rapidly protruding, by
evolution of the parts, a rather slender trunk, till it
attains about one-third the length of the body; then its
tip expands, and is seen to be surrounded by eight rows
of black points, and within these a circle of slender,
white, thread-like tentacles. These latter are the representatives
of the gorgeous head-plumes of the
Cucumber. Immediately the long trunk is turned out
to the outmost, it begins to be rolled in again; and this
process goes on with equal rapidity till it is quite con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>cealed.
Then again it is unrolled, and so on alternately.
Doubtless the function of respiration is performed by
this action; and perhaps also food is collected and
swallowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HERMIT SIPONCLE.</div>

<p>One species of this creature, the Hermit Siponcle,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
common enough with us, is in the habit of appropriating
old deserted shells of univalve mollusca, as the periwinkle,
or the pelican’s-foot, for its own residence. In
this case it builds up a wall of sand-atoms, cemented
by a glue of its own secreting, across the shell-aperture,
leaving only a small central orifice, through which
it may protrude its curious trunk.</p>

<p>Thus we discern the infinite and inexhaustible resources
of the Divine Wisdom in contrivances which
have for their object the preservation, sustentation, and
comfort of worms so obscure and humble as these.
Discerning, let us adore!</p>

<h2>II.<br />

FEBRUARY.</h2>


<p>What will Babbicombe Bay yield us this fine
February morning? One thing at least it yields, a
magnificent coast view; and this is scarcely affected
by the season. Let there be only a moderately clear
atmosphere, a sky chequered with blue spaces and
white wind-borne clouds, and snatches of sunshine
interchanging with shadows,&mdash;which last there will be,
of course, with such a sky,&mdash;and such a prospect cannot
fail to please.</p>

<p>And, indeed, this noble sweep of precipitous coast
can hardly be surpassed for beauty all round the sea-girt
shores of Britain. The forms of the cliffs are imposing:
their broad masses of vivid colour alternating,&mdash;the
white compact limestone, the bright red sandstone,
becoming almost scarlet as the sun shines out
full, yet prevented from being tawdry by its harmonies
with the various hues of green that crown it, by its
own breadth of light and shadow, by its dimming tints
as it softens and mellows into the purple of the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>tance;
the panorama of blue hills rising and fading far
inland, the Tors and heights of Dartmoor and Exmoor;
and the ever-changing sea, now laughing in its brightness,
now frowning and chafing in its wrath, filling so
vast an area as it does from this vantage height;&mdash;these
are the broader features of a scene which I will
pause a moment to depict in detail, before I descend to
the beach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIEW FROM BABBICOMBE CLIFF.</div>

<p>I take my stand on the margin of the cliff that overlooks
Oddicombe, my feet upon the short soft turf,
marked with fairy rings, the Dog’s Head just on my
left,&mdash;a remarkable projection of grey lichened limestone
from the very cliff-edge, which, seen from the
opposite side, bears a curious resemblance to the head
of a lop-eared, cross-grained cur; but from my point
of view far more forcibly presents the appearance of the
face of a night-capped old man, grinning with pain;&mdash;and
a fine vertical, and in some places overhanging,
precipice just on my right, in whose horizontal strata
scores of noisy jackdaws find resting ledges. I see
them as they sit in conscious security only a few yards
below the margin, their sleek grey polls wagging, and
their black eyes now and then upturned, as others of
the cawing tribe fly in, and seek sitting-room. Some of
the strata are strangely distorted at the western end;
and here a narrow and somewhat perilous track leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
down below the cliff to a grassy plateau at its foot. I
scramble down, and sit on a stony shelf, overhung with
sheets of ivy, and mark the bright green tufts of Sea-spleenwort
springing out of the clefts, unfortunately too
high to be reached.</p>

<p>The eye roams northward. At foot a rough broken
ground slopes steeply down, shaggy with thickets of
brake and bramble, and of furze which glows even now
with golden blossom, varied with great tracts of broken
fragments of limestone, blackened by the weather. At
length this merges into a broad beach of shingle, snowy
white, on which I see ladies reclining, with books and
parasols, as if ’twere July instead of February. The sea
bounds the beach with a line of still whiter surf, ever
renewing itself as it breaks, with a sweet whispering
sound. At the back is a series of most picturesque
cliffs of the reddest sandstone, on the top of which I
find in June the beautiful blossoms of the Purple
Gromwell, one of the rarest of British flowers. The
ground at the summit is very uneven; and so my
eye rests on the broad opposite slopes of Woodleigh
Vale, chequered with fields and hedgerows, among
which the ploughmen are busy, and the teams are
toiling up the steep furrows.</p>

<p>The formation suddenly changes again, and the limestone
is seen in the fine rounded projection of Petit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Tor, whose front of white marble has been laid bare by
the quarriers. Beyond this is the ruddy sandstone
once more rising into lofty headlands of noble shapes.
At the foot of one of these an isolated rock, called, from
its figure, the Bell, stands in the sea, where, even while
I am writing this paper, a mournful tragedy has occurred.
Two Babbicombe fishermen went out at midnight to
examine their crab-pots at this rock, and did not return.
The morning revealed the keel of the boat
bottom-up, moored by the pot-lines, and one poor
fellow entangled by his feet in the same lines, while
the sea washed his hair about the surface. The other
has not yet been found.</p>

<p>Farther on, the bluff Ness marks the harbour of Teignmouth,
and as the sunlight falls on the white villas that
stud the opposite side, the scene looks attractive. Then
the cliff-line rapidly diminishes in height as it recedes,
and the heads of Dawlish project, and we see no more
till at Exmouth the land trends to the eastward, and
from its white terraces faintly seen in the slanting sun
now, but to stand out full and clear in the afternoon,
we follow the bold, varying, beauteous coast, beauteous
in its outline, but dim in its detail, for some twenty
miles farther, till the straining eye finally fails to discern
it somewhere between Lyme and Bridport; though
Portland itself is sometimes to be seen, and I have my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>self
made it well out, stretching far forth upon the wide
eastern horizon of blue sea. Now, however, along that
shining line nothing is discernible but a white speck
or two, and yon ocean steamer that passes down the
Channel, with a long line of black smoke on the low
sky behind her.</p>

<p>I forsake my sheltered seat, and climb to the down,
making my way towards the left, in order to see the
prospect to the right. Here is a track winding down the
broken slope, leading through roods of the round leaves
of the fragrant Butterburr. A month ago the whole air
was loaded with the delicious perfume of its lilac blossom.
I make my way, slippery and tenacious enough
just now, along by the hedge of a field, till I come to
the edge of an abrupt perpendicular cliff. How beautiful
from hence is the sweet hamlet of Babbicombe the
Nether! The rugged masses of Black Wall project
from the foot of the slope into the sea, dividing Oddicombe
from Babbicombe beach. Beyond it is the
latter, a sweeping curve of pebbles and then of larger
boulders, backed by an amphitheatre of picturesque
fishing huts, and elegant villas, half hid in bowery
plantations and woods, with peeps of lawns and gardens,
all occupying the steep sides of the bay, up to the summit
of the downs.</p>

<p>Beyond the beach, fine dark rock masses again project;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and farther still, the prospect is abruptly shut in by a
magnificent vertical cliff of great height, the northern
boundary of that lovely spot of renown, Anstey’s Cove.</p>

<p>These features, which I feebly essay to paint with
many successive words, and multitudes of others which
I must fain leave untouched, the eye drinks in at once,
grasping the whole grand and beautiful picture at a
glance, steeped as it is in loveliness. Those who have
seen it may possibly find an aid to memory in recalling
it in these details of mine, for I write with the scene
before me; those who have not will probably find little
of interest in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BABBICOMBE BEACH.</div>

<p>It is at the farther end of yonder beach that we must
commence our marine explorings to-day; there, where
the pebbles at the lowest water-line merge into larger
dark stones, and a little on this side of the bounding
rocks. We might get down by this path to Oddicombe
beach, scramble over Black Wall, and so make our way
along Babbicombe beach to the spot; but the state of
the tenacious soil at this season makes such a descent
unpleasant. There is a better road to the eastward,
which winds among the villas, and descends direct to
the spot we seek. Let us therefore pursue our walk
over the downs, along the margin of the cliff, enjoying
fresh aspects of the coast view as we proceed, till we
reach the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>We are among the olive-coated stones at the verge of
the far-receded tide, among which the springs from the
cliffs having broken out from various points in the
shingle beach, are making for themselves tortuous channels
on their way to the deserting sea. Their water,
originally fresh of course, has, by the time it arrives
here, become so brackish by washing the salt stones
and sea-weeds, that the sand-hoppers and worms which
inhabit the hollows under the stones are bathed in it
with impunity, though, in general, immersion in fresh
water is fatal to marine animals. Great tufts of bladder
wrack and other <i>Fuci</i> spring from the lower stones, and
now lie flaccid about, awaiting the returning tide to
erect them and wave their leathery leaves to and fro.
Broad fronds of <i>Ulva</i>, too, like tissue paper of the tenderest
green, irregularly crumpled and waved, and
nibbled and gnawed into thousands of holes, lie crisp
and tempting; and tufts of a darker, duller green, and
others of purple-brown, and others again of rosy crimson,
stud these rough stones, and vary their ruggedness
with elegance and beauty; a beauty, however, far more
appreciable, and far more worthy of admiration, if we
could look upon it when the flowing tide creeps up,
with its calm water clear as crystal, and covers the
many-hued parterre, softening and displaying the graceful
outlines and the brilliant colours. Then, too, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
tiny creatures would be seen agilely swimming from
weed to weed, or lithely twining among the fronds,
which now we have to search for in their recluse hiding-places
under these rocks.</p>

<p>Selecting a stone which experience teaches us is a
likely one&mdash;-and only experience can teach this, though in
general I may say that the heaviest and flattest beneath,
those which appear to have been long undisturbed, and
especially those which, instead of being imbedded in
the soil, rest on other stones in such a partial way that
there is room for free ingress and egress to minute
creatures beneath, and which have a broad surface to
which they may cling in congenial darkness, are the
most promising&mdash;-selecting, I say, such a stone, we place
both hands beneath one side, and heave with all our
might to turn it bodily over. We must be careful, for
many of these stones are so beset with the small shells
of <i>Serpula triquetra</i>, that they cannot be handled with
impunity. This is a worm which makes a tubular pipe
for its defence, of hard shell, adhering to the rock
throughout its length; the tube enlarges a little as it
grows, and its most recent extremity, which is brilliantly
white and clean, is defended by the projecting
extremity of a ridge which runs along the back of the
shell, the point of this ridge forming a very sharp
needle-like prickle, which, as we apply our hands be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>neath
the stone to lift, terribly cuts the fingers. On
some stones we find hundreds of these treacherous
shells, set as thickly as they can stand, and covering
large patches; on others they are scattered, and some
are quite free from them. In an aquarium the little
worms protrude their breathing fans very constantly,
and are pretty, though not conspicuous objects, being
varied with bright blue, grey, and white. Pretty as
they are, however, the collector wishes them further a
hundred times during his collecting, for, in such an expedition
as this, he is fortunate indeed if he come home
without half of his fingers gashed with deep incisions,
smarting from the sea-water, and all the slower to heal
from the skin of the finger-tips being worn to thinness
in handling the stones.</p>

<p>But these are trifles; the fortune of war; amply
compensated by the joy of victory, when we succeed
in capturing some rare or lovely creature, to be displayed
in triumph within the glass walls of a prison.
Such an one is this beauty, which is lurking in an
angle of the block we have just overturned. It needs
a sharp eye to detect it; for we see no beauty yet,
nothing but a little lump of whitish jelly, dappled with
orange-yellow, not bigger than the half of a split pea,
clinging close to the stone. It requires some care to
get it up without crushing; the end of a toothpick, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
a penknife, or a bit of stick cut to a point, must be inserted
under it; thus we lift it, and drop it into the
ready phial of clear water. It opens instantly, sprawling
even before it reaches the bottom, where it at once
begins to crawl, and we detect in our prize the lovely
little Triope.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TRIOPE.</div>

<p>As it swiftly glides up the glass, we see that it has
an oblong body of a pellucid white hue, curiously beset
with finger-like appendages. There is a row of some
half-dozen or so fringing the front of the head; and
down a line on each side of the body, margining the
mantle, there is a row of larger ones, and all these are
tipped with the richest orange colour. Just behind the
frontal points there are two club-shaped organs, which
start up out of holes, the sides of which form sheaths
for them, into which they can be withdrawn at the will
of the animal. These organs carry a number of narrow
plates set parallel to each other, diagonally pointing
backwards and downwards. Doubtless, this structure
is intended to augment the sensitive powers of these
curious organs, which are understood to be the tentacles.</p>

<p>Then, in the middle line of the back, but placed a
little nearer the tail than the head, there is an orifice,
which is the vent; remarkable because the breathing
organs are arranged partly around it. There are three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tiny leaves cut like the fronds of a fern, which stand
up over the orifice, and are endowed with the power of
absorbing for the purposes of respiration the oxygen of
the air commingled in the water.</p>

<p>But here is an animal which possesses all these peculiarities
of structure, displayed on a much larger scale.
It is a fine specimen of the Sea Lemon,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which we
oftener find clinging to the sides of perpendicular rocks,
or beneath projecting ledges, than on the undersides of
stones. This fellow is two and a half inches long, and
an inch and a quarter or more broad; but I have met
with individuals much larger than he. Its back is
rounded, and its outline generally reminds one of the
half of a lemon cut longitudinally. The resemblance is
heightened, too, by the round warts with which the whole
surface is studded, and by the colour, a yellow more or
less pure, often, however, clouded, as in this instance,
with purple, by which its beauty is much enhanced.</p>

<p>The mantle, in this Doris, reaches down to the foot
on all sides, and covers the head, and is not furnished
with any appendages. The tentacles, which are plated,
as in the Triope, pierce through the mantle, and are
sheathed; the gill plumes are large and ample feather-like
organs, eight in number, forming a complete circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
round the orifice, in the manner of a beautiful expanded
flower.</p>

<p>As the Doris crawls along, it now and then lifts and
puckers the edge of the mantle, and displays its under
surface and that of the foot, which are of a rich orange-scarlet
hue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CROWNED EOLIS.</div>

<p>But we have turned a stone beneath which lurk
several specimens of a much lovelier creature yet. I
see by the gleams of crimson and azure which shine
out from it, that it must be the Crowned Eolis.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It
looked a little heap of fibrous semi-pellucid flesh when
out of water, and, like the Triope, must be immersed to
display its beauties. Now in the phial of water, how
elegant it is! Its body is long and slender, tapering
away to an almost imperceptible point behind, of a
clear translucent white. The head forms two long
smooth taper tentacles, which wave hither and thither
as the creature gracefully glides along; and besides
these it has two other tentacles, distinguished as the
dorsal pair, resembling, in their position and in their
structure, those of the Doris and Triope, but not
sheathed.</p>

<p>The chief glory of this exquisite animal, however, is
in its breathing organs. These consist of clusters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
finger-shaped papillæ, set transversely across the back,
in about six rows, with the middle line of the back free.
Each of these papillæ is pellucid, with a central core of
the richest crimson, while a very brilliant flush of steel
blue is reflected from the surface, and the tip is opaque
white. The combination of these hues has a most
charming effect.</p>

<p>You would scarcely suppose such lovely creatures
were fierce and carnivorous; but they are the most
determined enemies of the Sea Anemones. This beautiful
Eolis I have often seen assaulting an Anemone,
ferociously tearing away its tentacles, or gnawing great
holes in its side, and, when touched, stiffening and
erecting all its brilliant papillæ, as the porcupine does
its quills.</p>

<p>All these creatures are Mollusca very closely allied
to the Cowry and the Trochus which we lately examined,
but destitute of a shell. The exposure of the
breathing organs is a distinguishing character (these being
more commonly, in the order, concealed in a cavity),
whence they are called <i>Nudibranchiata</i>, or Naked-gilled
Mollusks.</p>

<p>At this season, wherever we find the animals themselves,
we may with confidence expect to find their
spawn. This is deposited in masses, which possess
characteristic forms. Thus this roll, which looks as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
you had made a thin ribbon of paste, half an inch wide,
and rolled it into a loose scroll of two or three turns,
and then affixed it by its edge to the under side of a
stone, is the spawn-mass of the Sea Lemon. And here
is a much more elegant scroll, of which the constituent
is a slender thread, twisted into a frilled or figure-8
form, as it goes on to make the spire.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This has been
laid by the beautiful Crowned Eolis. If you examine
either of these masses with a lens, you will see that it
is composed of a vast multitude of white eggs, suspended
in a clear jelly, in which they are arranged in
transverse rows, giving the opaque appearance to what
would else be colourless and transparent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EGGS OF NUDIBRANCHS.</div>

<p>The eggs, watched day by day under a good microscopic
power, as they advance towards maturity, present
a most interesting object of study. The yolk, which at
first nearly fills the egg-shell, soon becomes a little
elongated, with one end diagonally truncated, or, as it
were, cut off obliquely; the truncated end then becomes
two-lobed, “each lobe exhibiting an imperfect spiral,
and having its margin ciliated. The now animated
being is seen to rotate within its prison. Shortly the
lobes enlarge, and a fleshy process, the rudimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
foot, is observed to develop itself a little behind them,
on the medial line; a shell closely investing the inferior
portion of the embryo, the lobes and rudimentary
foot being uppermost. The shell rapidly increases, and
assumes a nautiloid form; afterwards the foot displays,
attached to its posterior surface, a circular operculum,
which is opposed to the mouth of the shell. The lobes
now expand into two large, flattened, ovate appendages,
with very long vibratile cilia around the margins; and
the larvæ are at length mature. The whole mass of
spawn now presents the utmost animation. Hundreds
of these busy atoms are seen, each within its transparent,
membranous cell, rotating with great agility
and ceaseless perseverance, the cilia all the while vigorously
vibrating on the margins of the outstretched
lobes. The membranous chorion [or transparent egg-shell],
which by this time has become enlarged, ultimately
gives way, no longer able to resist the perpetual
struggle within; and the liberated larva, wending its
way through the shattered shreds of the general envelope,
boldly trusts itself to the open trackless water, where,
doubtless, thousands and tens of thousands perish ere
they find a fitting resting-place, some being swept away
by resistless currents, others falling a prey to ever-watchful
and innumerable enemies.</p>

<p>“When the larva is at rest, the oral lobes are pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
back into the shell, and the foot being drawn down,
brings along with it the operculum, which closes the
orifice. But when in action, the whole of these parts
project beyond the opening of the shell, the foot lying
back against the spire; and the oral lobes inclining
forward, their cilia commence to vibrate, and the larva,
with the mouth of the shell upwards, moves through
the water with lively action, sinking or rising, or advancing
onwards at its pleasure.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPAWN OF EOLIS.</div>

<p>The fecundity of these mollusca is immense. An <i>Eolis
papillosa</i> of moderate size in one of my aquaria, deposited
successively nine strings of spawn between
March 20th and May 24th. The strings were exactly
alike in length and arrangement; each comprised
about 105 convolutions, and each convolution 200
eggs, while each egg contained on an average two
embryos. Thus the astonishing number of 378,000
embryos proceeded from this one animal in about
two months.</p>

<p>Step by step we have crept along the beach, turning
stones as we went, till we are come to the great masses
of sandstone rock. Here are the Purples<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> by hundreds,
with their strong massive shells, some of them pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
white, which, however, becomes dingy with age, some
banded with brown, and some, especially the young and
half-grown ones, painted with a dull but soft purplish
hue. The older specimens have the inner surface of
the lip tinged with a rich rosy purple. This tint on the
shell we may receive as the advertisement of the colorific
property that resides within, a sort of sign-board to tell
us that this is the “genuine” purple-shell. And there
is little doubt that it is one of those enumerated by
Pliny, as used by the ancients for obtaining the renowned
dye of Tyre: though the principal, and that which
yielded the richest hue, was probably the <i>Murex trunculus</i>,
a common Mediterranean shell, which does not
extend to our shores.</p>

LIMPET. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  PURPLE. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  SLIT-LIMPET.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>My readers are, I dare say, familiar with the pretty
myth which professes to embody the discovery of the
purple dye. The Tyrian Hercules was one day walking
with his sweetheart along the shore, followed by her
lap-dog, when the playful animal seized a shell that
had just been washed up on the beach. Its lips were
presently dyed with a gorgeous purple tint, which was
traceable to a juice that was pressed out of the shell-fish.
The lady was charmed with the colour, and longed
to have a dress of it; and, as wishes under such circumstances
are laws, the enamoured hero set himself to
gratify her, and soon succeeded in extracting and apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>ing
the dye, which afterwards became so famous. I
have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> recorded my own experiments on the
stain yielded by the <i>Purpura</i> before us, with the
remarkable changes through which it passes before the
sunlight fully brings out the colour. The use of
cochineal makes us independent of molluscan dyes,
and the matter is merely one of antiquarian interest,
or a question of zoological chemistry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EGGS OF DOG-WINKLE.</div>

<p>Perhaps you may be more interested in the development
of the Dog-winkle. Under the ledges of rocks
we find in abundance groups of little yellow bodies,
resembling ninepins in shape, set on their ends in close
contact with each other, and varying in numbers from
three or four to a hundred or upwards in a group.
Some of them are tinged with purple at the tips; and
while sometimes you find them closed, and full of a
yellow creamy substance, at others they are open at the
top, and empty.</p>

<p>These are the egg-capsules of this mollusk, and some
very unusual circumstances connected with the birth of
the progeny, and their development within these cases,
have been discovered by Dr. Carpenter.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Each capsule
contains 500 or 600 globules that cannot be distinguished
from each other at first; but only twelve to thirty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
these are developed into young animals, though their
united bulk ultimately equals that of the whole mass.
The greater number of these globules are not real eggs,
but only “yolk-spherules,” destined to afford nutriment
to the true embryos, which greedily swallow them,
after certain changes have taken place, and increase
rapidly in bulk. It is curious, however, that they do
not advance in development during this absorption of
nutriment, but are, so to speak, arrested until a great
augmentation of size is thus attained; then they quickly
acquire the form of little free-swimming nautiloids,
closely like those of the Doris and Eolis, a form which
indeed is common to the early stages of all the known
higher mollusca, however various may be their adult
conditions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIMPET.</div>

<p>Here are the familiar Limpets, too: let us look at
<i>them</i> awhile.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They are not generally very attractive
in appearance, the shell being coarse and rubbed,
especially in the larger specimens; and in an aquarium
they do not live long, and are so inert as to afford no
amusement even while they survive. Yet we occasionally
find examples prettily coloured; and there are facts
in their economy which make them worthy of a few
moments’ notice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<p>If you look carefully over the rocks, especially when
these are of a somewhat soft nature, as the slates and
shales, you will find oval depressions, sometimes but
just discernible, at other times sunk to the depth of an
eighth of an inch, corresponding in outline to the shell
of a Limpet; and in many instances you will actually
see a Limpet imbedded in such a pit, which it accurately
fills. Strange as it may seem, it has been ascertained
that these cavities are formed by the animals, which
make them their ordinary resting-places, wandering
away from them nightly to feed, and returning to them
to rest early in the morning.</p>

<p>The force with which a Limpet adheres to the rock
is very great, especially when it has had warning of
assault, and has had time to put out its muscular
strength. Réaumur found that a weight of twenty-eight
or thirty pounds was required to overcome this
adhesive force. His experiments seem to prove, however,
that its power is mainly owing, not to muscular
energy, nor to the production of a vacuum in the manner
of a sucker. If an adhering Limpet were cut quite
through perpendicularly, shell and animal, the two
parts maintained their hold with unabated force, although
of course a vacuum, if there had been one, would
have been destroyed by the incision. The power is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
said to reside in a very strong glue, a very viscid secretion,
deposited at the will of the animal. “If, having
detached a <i>Patella</i>,” says Dr. Johnston, “the finger be
applied to the foot of the animal, or to the spot on
which it rested, the finger will be held there by a very
sensible resistance, although no glue is perceptible.
And it is remarkable that if the spot be now moistened
with a little water, or if the base of the animal be cut,
and the water contained in it allowed to flow over the
spot, no further adhesion will occur on the application
of the finger: the glue has been dissolved. It is
nature’s solvent, by which the animal loosens its own
connexion with the rock. When the storm rages, or
when an enemy is abroad, it glues itself firmly to its
rest; but when the danger has passed, to free itself
from this forced constraint, a little water is pressed from
the foot, the cement is weakened, and it is at liberty to
raise itself and be at large. The fluid of cementation,
as well as the watery solvent, is secreted in an infinity
of miliary glands with which the foot is, as it were,
shagreened; and as the Limpet cannot supply the
secretion as fast as this can be exhausted, you may
destroy the animal’s capacity of fixation by detaching
it forcibly two or three times in succession.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GILLS.</div>

<p>If we remove one of these Limpets from his selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
area of rock,&mdash;which we may readily do, notwithstanding
the strength of his cement, if we take him at unawares,
and give him a smart sudden horizontal rap with a
piece of wood, or a moderated blow with a hammer,&mdash;we
shall obtain a view of a structure well worth looking
at. The animal is essentially like a Trochus or a Purple
inhabiting a conical shell; only in this case the cone
is low and simple, whereas in the others it is tall and
slender, and rolled into a spire. One of the most
curious peculiarities in the Limpet is its gill or breathing
organ. This, we perceive, completely encircles the
animal, forming a ring interrupted only at one point.
It lies in the fold between the mantle and the foot,
commencing on the left side of the neck, and passing
quite round the body, parallel with the edge of the
shell, in front of the head, till it terminates close to the
point where it began. It is a long cord closely beset
with tiny leaflets, and thus forming a continual plume.
Each leaflet, conical in outline, is permeated with blood-vessels,
and clothed with minute <i>cilia</i>, whose constant
vibrations cause the circumambient water ever to play
over the surface of these organs in ceaseless currents,
bringing fresh supplies of oxygen to be respired; and
this is absorbed by the blood through the thin membrane
by which they are protected.</p>

<p>There is a very pretty little shell, not uncommon in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
deep water off these coasts, but rarely found by the
shore collector, though it does occasionally venture to
peep at daylight at the verge of extreme low-tide. It
is the Slit Limpet,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which by the older naturalists was
placed in close alliance with the Limpets proper, as if
a member of the same family. They were, however,
deceived by paying too exclusive attention to the form
of the shell, which is a cone, somewhat rounded, and
nearly simple, the summit being slightly turned over in
a backward direction. The margin of the shell is delicately
notched, the points being the extremities of the
radiating ridges; for the entire surface is covered with
reticulations, one series of alternate furrows and ridges
proceeding from the summit to the margin, and another
series crossing these at right angles, running round the
shell parallel with the margin. The animal has its sides
ornamented with short fleshy processes, and possesses
two symmetrical gill-plumes, one on each side. It is
rather attractive in appearance, but I cannot tell you
anything of its manners; for though I have kept specimens
in the aquarium, they are so habitually sluggish,
and so reluctant to allow one a peep beneath the edge
of the jealous shell, that I could learn nothing about
their ways;&mdash;if indeed they have any.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PHOLAS HOLES.</div>

<p>Another curious form closely related to this is the
Keyhole Limpet,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> whose shell is of a long oval outline,
of a lower cone, reticulated, like the Slit Limpet, but
pierced at the summit with a double hole, or rather a
perforation apparently made of two holes broken into
one, something like a keyhole. This orifice, like the
slit in the former case, is for the discharge of the effete
water taken in in breathing.</p>

<p>See! here is the soft red sandstone lying in great
beds, pierced through and through with smooth round
holes, just as if bored with a carpenter’s auger, big
enough to admit a man’s thumb. What agency has
been in operation to effect these perforations? Let us
try to discover.</p>

<p>A few good blows with the stout hammer on the
chisel-head serve to split off a great slice of the coarse
red sandstone. The holes run through its substance,
but they are all empty, or filled only with the black
fœtid mud which the sea has deposited in their cavities.
Yes; these are too superficial; they are all deserted;
the stone lies too high above low-water mark: we must
seek a lower level. Try here; where the lowest spring-tide
only just leaves the rock bare. Ha! now we have
uncovered the operators. Here lie, snugly ensconced
within the tubular perforations, great mollusca, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
ample ivory-like shells, which yet cannot half contain
the whiter flesh of their ampler bodies, and the long
stout yellow siphons that project from one extremity,
reaching far up the hole towards the surface of the
rock.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>We lift one from its cavity, all helpless and unresisting,
yet manifesting its indignation at the untimely
disturbance by successive spasmodic contractions of
these rough yellow siphons, each accompanied with a
forcible <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jet d’eau</i>, a polite squirt of sea-water into our
face; while, at each contraction in length, the base
swells out, till the compressed valves of the sharp shell
threaten to pierce through its substance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYPOTHESES OF THEIR FORMATION.</div>

<p>Strange as it seems, these animals have bored these
holes in the stone; and they are capable of boring in
far harder rock than this; even in compact limestone.
The actual mode in which this operation is performed
long puzzled philosophers. Some maintained that the
animal secreted an acid which had the power of dissolving
not only various kinds of stone, but also wood,
amber, wax, and other substances, in which the excavations
are occasionally made. But it was hard to imagine
a solvent of substances so various, and to know how
the animals’ own shells were preserved from its action;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
while, confessedly, no such acid had ever been detected
by the most careful tests.</p>

<p>Others maintained that the rough points which stud
the shell enable it to serve as a rasp, which the animal,
by rotating on its axis, uses to wear away the stone or
other material; but it was difficult to understand how
it was that the shell itself was not worn away in the
abrasion.</p>

<p>Another zoologist, rejecting this hypothesis, maintained
that the edges of the mantle and the short thick
foot are the instruments employed; and that, though
these fleshy organs seem little fitted for such work,
they are really endowed with the requisite power in
the shape of crystals of flint which are deposited thickly
in their substance. Strange to say, however, other
accurate observers fail to detect these siliceous crystals,
and therefore reject the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Another suggested that the stone was removed in invisible
particles by the constant action of currents in
the water, produced by vibratile cilia seated on the soft
parts of the animal; but this supposition was found
untenable on examination.</p>

<p>Actual observation in the aquarium has proved that
the second hypothesis is the true one. M. Cailliaud in
France and Mr. Robertson in England have demonstrated
that the Pholas uses its shell as a rasp, wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
away the stone with the asperities with which the anterior
parts of the valves are furnished. Between these
gentlemen a somewhat hot contention was maintained
for the honour of priority in this valuable discovery.
M. Cailliaud himself used the valves of the dead shell,
and imitating the natural conditions as well as he could,
actually bored an imitative hole, by making them rotate.
Mr. Robertson, at Brighton, exhibited to the public
living Pholades in the act of boring in masses of chalk.
He described it as “a living combination of three instruments,
viz., a hydraulic apparatus, a rasp, and a
syringe.” But the first and last of these powers can be
considered only as accessory to the removing of the detritus
out of the way, when once the hole was bored,
the <i>rasp</i> being the real power. If you examine these
living shells, you will see that the fore part, where the
foot protrudes, is set with stony points arranged in
transverse and longitudinal rows, the former being the
result of elevated ridges radiating from the hinge, the
latter that of the edges of successive growths of the
shell. These points have the most accurate resemblance
to those set on a steel rasp in a blacksmith’s
shop. It is interesting to know that the shell is preserved
from being itself prematurely worn away by the
fact, that it is composed of arragonite, a substance much
harder than those in which the Pholas burrows. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
we see by the specimens before us that such a destructive
action does in time take place, for some of these
have the rasping points much more worn than others,
many of the older ones being nearly smooth.</p>

<p>The animal turns in its burrow from side to side
when at work, adhering to the interior by the foot, and
therefore only partially rotating to and fro. The substance
is abraded in the form of fine powder, which is
periodically ejected from the mouth of the hole by the
contraction of the branchial siphon; a good deal of the
more impalpable portions being deposited by the current
as it proceeds, and lodging as a soft mud between
the valves and the stone. Mr. Hudson,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who watched
some Pholades at work in a tide-pool in the chalk,
observed the periodic ejection of the cloud of chalk-powder,
and noticed the heaps of the same material deposited
around the mouth of each burrow. The discharges
were made with no regularity as to time. Mrs.
Merrifield<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> records a curious fact. “A lady, watching
the operations of some Pholades which were at
work in a basin of sea-water, perceived that two of
them were boring at such an angle that their tunnels
would meet. Curious to ascertain what they would
do in this case, she continued her observations, and
found that <i>the larger and stronger Pholas bored straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
through the weaker one</i>, as if it had been merely a piece
of chalk rock.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ross, of Rhyl, having a Pholas in his aquarium,
prepared a piece of wood, by excavating a shallow cavity,
about a quarter of an inch deep, in which he set the
animal, whose shell was two inches long. “After a
short time the animal attached its foot to the bottom of
the hole and commenced swaying itself from side to
side, until the hole was of sufficient depth to allow it
to proceed in the following manner:&mdash;It inflated itself
with water, apparently to its fullest extent, raising its
shell upwards from the hole; then holding by its muscular
foot, it drew its shell gradually down. This
would have produced a perpendicular and very inefficient
action, but for a wise provision of nature. The
edges of the valves are not joined close together, but
are connected by a membrane (extension of the mantle),
and instead of being joined at the hinge (umbo) like
ordinary bivalves, they possess an extra plate, attached
to each valve of the shell, which is necessary for the
following operation:&mdash;In boring, this mollusk, having
dilated itself with water, draws down its shell within
the hole, gradually closing the lower anterior edges until
they almost touch. It then raises its shell upwards,
gradually opening the lower anterior edges, and closing
the upper, thus boring both upwards and downwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
The spines are placed in rows, like the teeth of
a saw; those towards the lower part of the shell being
sharp and pointed, while those above, being now useless,
are not renewed.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">RED-NOSES.</div>

<p>In this limestone cliff we shall find other borers, for
you may see even at a considerable distance how holed
and honeycombed its surface is; the cavities being so
numerous, so close, and so irregular in their direction,
that the whole face of the rock is fashioned into small
sharp-edged shapeless points. Nor need we be long in
finding the industrious masons who thus rough-point
acres upon acres, nay miles upon miles, of limestone
rock. Here in ten thousand orifices you discern little
double-tipped knobs of crimson flesh, which, as soon as
you disturb them, shoot at you a column of water and
then disappear within their fortress, having exhausted
their artillery. The fishermen know them well, and use
them for bait, applying to them the familiar but expressive
soubriquet of Red-noses.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>It is not so easy to get at these as at the Pholades,
because of the superior hardness of the stone which they
excavate. With the chisel, however, we need not fail
of uncovering a few, especially as their burrows are but
shallow. Here they are, half-a-dozen in a block as big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
as your fist. Ugly, uncouth, bemired, the valves not
nearly containing the shapeless flesh, they are not particularly
attractive creatures, maugre the brilliant hue
of their blushing siphons. Like Mrs. Merrifield’s
Pholas, these Saxicavæ habitually break into one
another’s houses, as we see here, and even cut one
another’s shells and bodies through and through most
ruthlessly. They will live very well out of the rock,
and may be kept a considerable time in the aquarium.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the burrowing Mollusca are
slowly but surely effecting changes in the configuration
of rocky coasts, by destroying the rock. It is true their
excavations extend but a few inches in depth; but then,
as the force of the elements readily breaks down the
thin partitions left standing, and discovers a new face,
so the borers are continually renewing their attacks on
this; and so in time the cliffs are worn away, while the
debris of impalpable mud is deposited upon the shallows,
entering into new combinations, and filling up estuaries
and harbours.</p>

<h2>III.<br />

MARCH.</h2>


<p>Perhaps the most effective aid to the investigation
of natural history which the present age has produced
is the invention of the aquarium, and particularly its
application to marine forms of life. Depending on that
grand principle of organic chemistry, of world-wide
prevalence, that the emanations from animals and vegetables
are respectively essential to the continued life
each of the other, it was discovered that the relative
proportions of number and bulk in which organic
beings of the two kinds could healthfully live together
was easily determined; and since the fact that the
creatures were inhabitants of water, whether fresh or
salt, presented no exception to the universality of the
law, they had but to be placed together in a suitable
ratio, enclosed in a vessel containing water, and an
aquarium was established. Improvements in the form
of the vessel, in the mode of exposing the contents to
observation, in the impact of the rays of light, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
arrangement of the interior, and other points of value,
have indeed been progressively made; whereby the practical
availability of the invention for the purposes of
experimental natural history has been augmented; but
some of us have found little difficulty, even from the
very first announcement of the discovery, in maintaining
the collections of sea-water, with their living plants
and animals, unchanged from year’s end to year’s end.
I may be perhaps excused for observing, that I have at
present in use a large tank, full of marine creatures, in
which the water has been unchanged for four years, and
on which I look with peculiar interest, because it was the
first tank ever made for private use. This very aquarium
has afforded, and still affords the opportunity for the
observation of many interesting details of the structure
and habits of the lower forms of animal life, details
which constitute the basis not only of my works on
marine natural history already published, but of the
present series of papers also. We collect the creatures,
indeed, abroad, and there gather up some broad facts of
interest concerning their modes of life; but it is at
home, in the quiet of the study, with conveniences
and aids to examination, experiment, and record at
command, that they must be studied. The aquarium
becomes in fact an apparatus, whereby we bring a
portion of the sea, with its rocks, and weeds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
creatures, to the side of our study-table, and maintain
it there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">USE OF THE AQUARIUM.</div>

<p>Thus an opportunity of close and valuable familiarity
with sea-productions is open to multitudes who have
never seen the broad expanse of ocean, nor searched its
prolific shores; and facilities for extending the bounds
of zoological science are everywhere enjoyed, which till
lately were restricted to a very few naturalists, whose
residences were situated on certain favourable spots
upon the coast. Yet both modes of investigation are
necessary. He who has never seen marine animals
except in the confinement of an aquarium, cannot but
be conscious of many chasms in his knowledge, which
are filled up by him who is in the habit of collecting
his own specimens in their proper haunts; and who, by
finding them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ferâ naturâ</i>, can, when he studies them
at leisure in his tanks, make such allowances as are
necessary for the variations in habit which may be
dependent on the difference between their present
artificial, and their original natural, conditions of existence.</p>

<p>While we rejoice then in tanks and vases of crystal
water, filled with the lovely forms and brilliant hues of
sea-weeds and sea-anemones, I invite my readers to
accompany me on a few hours’ visit to the charming
creatures at their own homes. The season is propi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tious;
the sun has just passed the vernal equinox, and
the genial warmth of spring is diffusing new life into
the cold blood of the animals that dwell beneath the
waters; the equinoctial storms that lately raged have
blown themselves out, and are succeeded by a quietude
whose effect is delightfully seen in yonder mirror-like
ocean: it is the time of spring-tide; and the near
approach of the hour of lowest water will afford us
unusual facilities for finding species only to be invaded
under such conditions.</p>

<p>Let us then scramble down to the beautiful Anstey’s
Cove, along the steep path tangled with briers and
ferns; where the swelling buds of the hawthorn and
honeysuckle are already bursting, while the blackbird
mellowly whistles in the fast-greening thicket, and the
lark joyously greets the mounting sun above us. Yonder
on the shingle lies a boat, newly painted in white
and green, for the attraction of young ladies of maritime
aspirations; she is hauled up high and dry; but the
sinewy arms of honest Harry Bate, who hearing footsteps
has come out of his little grotto under the rock
to reconnoitre, will soon drag her down to the rippling
waves, and, “for the small sum of a shilling an hour,”
will pull us over the smooth and pond-like sea, whithersoever
we may choose to direct him.</p>

<p>“Jump aboard, please, Sir! Jump in, ladies! jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in, little master!” And now, as we take our seats on
the clean canvas cushions astern, the boat’s bottom
scrapes along with a harsh grating noise over the white
shingle-pebbles, and we are afloat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-CAVERN.</div>

<p>First to the caverns just outside yonder lofty point.
The lowness of the tide will enable us to take the boat
into them, and the calmness of the sea will preclude
much danger of her striking the rocks; especially as
watchful Bate will be on the alert, boat-hook in hand,
to keep her clear. Now we lie in the gloom of the
lofty arch, gently heaving and sinking and swaying on
the slight swell, which, however smooth the surface, is
always perceptible when you are in a boat among rocks,
and which invests such an approach with a danger that
a landsman does not at all appreciate. Yet the water,
despite the swell, is glassy, and invites the gaze down
into its crystalline depths, where the little fishes are
playing and hovering over the dark weeds. The sides
of the cavern rise around us in curved planes, washed
smooth and slippery by the dashing of the waves of
ages, and gradually merge into the massive angles and
projections and groins of the broken roof, whence a tuft
or two of what looks like samphire depends. But
notice the colonies of the Smooth Anemone or Beadlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
clustered about the sides; many of them are adhering
to the stone walls, several feet above the water. These
have been left uncovered for hours, and are none the
worse for it. They are closed, the many tentacles being
concealed by the involution of the upper part of the
body, so that they look like balls, or hemispheres, or
semi-ovals of flesh; or like ripe fruits, so plump and
succulent and glossy and high-coloured, that we are
tempted to stretch forth the willing hand, to pluck
and eat. Some are greengages, some Orleans plums,
some magnum-bonums,&mdash;so various are their rich hues;
but look beneath the water, and you see them not less
numerous, but of quite another guise. These are all
widely expanded; the tentacles are thrown out in an
arch over the circumference, leaving a broad flat disk;
just like a many-petalled flower of gorgeous hues: indeed,
we may fancy that here we see the blossoms, and
there the ripened fruit. Do not omit, however, to notice
the beads of pearly blue that stud the margin all round,
at the base of the over-arching tentacles. These have
been supposed by some to be eyes; the suggestion,
however, rests on no anatomical ground, and is, I am
afraid, worthless; though I cannot tell you what purpose
they do serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TANGLE FORESTS.</div>

<p>Away! for I wish to explore another scene not less
romantic than this, and which I know by experience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
be much more prolific in strange and beautiful forms of
life. Harry shall pull us round yonder low point, which
bears the appellation of Hope’s Nose, calling on the way
to look at some one of the inlets that lie between the
long projecting points at the foot of Black Rock. Here
the boat floats over dense forests of great brown sea-weeds,
the <i>Laminariæ</i>, which lift their dark masses, and
wave to and fro, with a majestic dignity. Here is the
narrow crumpled blade of the Oarweed, of a rich yellow
brown; and the wavy stem of the Furbelows springing
from its hedgehog-like bladder; but chiefly is the forest
composed of vast plants of the Tangle, whose broad
deep-brown fronds of a substance like stout leather,
French-polished, divide into many long straps, slide
over each other, and flap to and fro in the heave of the
sea. Yonder we see on the broadest part of a frond,
just before it divides, what seems a flower, as large as a
chrysanthemum, but of the liveliest pea-green hue, every
long petal tipped with rosy pink. Hand over the boat-hook,
and carefully lift the tangle to the surface. Now
we have it fully in view. It is the green variety of the
Opelet;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> so called because it is scarcely capable of infolding
the walls of the body over the disk and tentacles;
these therefore remain habitually <i>open</i>, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the animal is at times much less expanded than at
others. We now see it in its most charming condition;
the short fawn-coloured column inflated, the mouth
elevated on a strong cone in the centre of the wide
saucer-shaped disk, and the numerous tentacles arranged
in groups, as if several stems sprang from the same
root, long, slender, very flexible, twisting about like the
snaky locks of Medusa’s head, all of the most delicate
light green, with a rich satin lustre, and all tipped
with the richest crimson-lilac or light rose,&mdash;a most
beautiful harmony of colours. The animal adheres by
a broad base firmly to the disk of the tangle, and awaits,
as it waves hither and thither, the approach of one of
the little fishes that play heedlessly at bo-peep among
the fronds. No sooner does one of them touch the
far-stretching tentacles, than a virulent and penetrating
poison shoots through its frame; its vigour is benumbed
in an instant; it ceases to struggle; its powerful fins
strike the water no more; others of the fatal tentacles
enwrap themselves around it, and drag it towards the
mouth, already protruding and expanding in expectation
of the morsel; where it is in a few minutes engulfed,
and soon digested in that capacious maw.</p>

GREEN OPELET. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ORANGE-DISK ANEMONE.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is not very uncommon for a single specimen of
this species to become two by a perpendicular division.
The whole process has been observed. A little notch first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
appears in the margin of the disk, which extends, cutting
through the tentacles of that side, splitting the disk
across, proceeding through the tentacles on the opposite
side till it divides the margin there also. Meanwhile,
it has advanced downward in an equal ratio, till it has
reached the base; and at length there are two half-opelets
still adhering in the closest proximity. Now,
however, the two raw and open surfaces close up, and
the bases glide gradually apart. A thick wall of flesh
forms between the stomach and the wound, and new
tentacles develop themselves on this. The two Opelets
are complete.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAISED BEACHES.</div>

<p>Half-an-hour’s vigorous pulling has doubled the long
promontory of Hope’s Nose, a wilderness of stones, like
what I suppose, from published descriptions, the foot of
Mount Sinai to be, and brought us, between two raised
beaches, into the pretty cove of Meadfoot, capped by
elegant villas. These beaches, evidences of the lifting
of the land, for they surely once stood, as beaches stand
now, at the sea-level, are situate, the one on the main,
the other on the Thatcher, a rocky islet some two
hundred yards off shore. A few minutes more, and we
are in a wild scene indeed. Isolated rocks stand up, in
angular masses, upright columns, and sharp peaks, out
of the sea, which is quite deep, even at lowest spring-tide.
The coast itself too is rugged, precipitous, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
many spots quite perpendicular; one bold promontory,
which runs out with a narrow knife-edge summit, is
perforated by a natural archway of lofty elevation, of
very striking aspect. It is distinctly visible for miles
along the shores of Torbay, and is dignified with the
name of London Bridge.</p>

<p>Here, then, is our fishing-ground to-day. Threading
the slender passages between the perpendicular rocks,
or creeping-in close under their overhanging landward
sides, where no ray of the sun has ever penetrated, we
hang on by the points and groins, and eagerly peer
below. Into one lane our boatman hesitates to venture.
It is but just wide enough to allow the boat to pass;
indeed here and there she cannot without rubbing her
gunwales; and if a stronger swell than usual were to
roll-in from seaward while entangled, her side might
be stove-in before she could be extricated. However,
its gloom looks so tempting, and the water among the
islets is so very smooth, that we succeed in persuading
him, and we push and drag into the very midst of the
watery alley. The rocks rise close on either hand like
lofty walls, and descend as perpendicularly, deep and
far down beneath our keel; as we can well see, for the
water is of lustrous transparency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LIFE ON SEA-ROCKS.</div>

<p>And what a sight is here! Hundreds of Anemones
of many species are studding the walls almost as thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
as they can be packed. Every tiny crevice, every
hollow, every hole left by <i>Pholas</i> or <i>Saxicava</i> (and the
rock is riddled and honeycombed by these burrowing
mollusks), holds its little knob of plump flesh; some
lolling out with a dewdrop hanging from the end; some
just filling the cavity, and allowing the tips of the
crowded tentacles to peep out as a speck of white, or
of orange, or of rosy lilac, according to the species; and
some retreated to the bottom of their stony fortress, to
be detected only by the probing touch. Other forms
too there are;&mdash;dead men’s fingers, white and yellow;
worms, green and brown and grey, twining in and out,
and grasping the sharp edges of the rock; tunicate
mollusks, simple and compound; univalves and bivalves;
sponges of all bright colours by hundreds:&mdash;what a
maze, what a teeming world of life it is!</p>

<p>All this is at and above the level of the eye. Now
let us bend over the boat’s gunwale, and gaze below,
with our faces brought nearly to the surface of the sea.
Here the sight is far more wonderful, and far more
attractive; for here the life is seen in all its fullest
activity, every creature performing its functions, and
pursuing its instincts with the most single earnestness,
self-contained, and altogether regardless of the myriad
fellow-beings that surround it and press upon it, in this
eager contest and struggle for maintained existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DEAD MAN’S FINGER.</div>

<p>A yard or two below the surface the eye is caught by
a great oyster projecting from the vertical wall. It is
a strange situation for an oyster to be in, but it shows
how the infant young, in their free-swimming form, so
different from their ultimate condition, may be carried
by the aid of their own cilia, and the sea-currents, into
the most improbable situations, and may there find circumstances
congenial for permanent settlement.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Perhaps,
however, its brown and rough shell would scarcely
have attracted our notice, but for the rider that sits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
upon it. A specimen of the Dead-man’s finger,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of noble
dimensions, has selected this shell as the seat of its
dominion; and we can discern the three or four great
lobes of which it consists all surrounded by the gauzy
cloud that tells of the thousands of translucent polyps
projected from every part of its periphery. Fine as is
that specimen, however, there are scores of others, many
of which are of equal dimensions, and more easily accessible.
By the aid of the hammer and cold-chisel,
we may easily secure a specimen without harming it,
after searching a while to select one which is seated on
some projection of the rock that can be struck off.
Thus removed, and at once transferred to one of our
collecting jars, the curious compound animal will in
captivity display its beauties, though, it must be confessed,
it is often rather bashful before company. The
lobes into which the mass is divided are sufficiently like
stumpy fingers to have given it a popular designation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
while their dull white hue has suggested that the
fingers are those of a corpse. The animal is sometimes,
however, called Cows’ paps, and sometimes Mermaids’
gloves; but I think this latter is a book name.</p>

<p>When we examine it in the aquarium, after it has
recovered its equanimity disturbed by the rude shocks
of the hammer battering about its castle, we see that
the lobes are greatly swollen and sub-pellucid, from the
imbibition of water into the canals with which its
whole substance is penetrated. When out of water the
surface was studded with shallow pits, as if the poor
thing had at some period of its history been afflicted
with the small-pox. Now, however, these pittings reveal
their true character; for each has protruded itself
in the form of a long but slender polyp, of exquisite
translucency and perfect symmetry. It resembles a
tubular flower with eight narrow pointed petals, which
arch outward like those of a campanula or tulip. Each
petal carries on its edges a row of very slender transparent
filaments, arranged like the teeth of a comb,
which also arch downward, and greatly augment the
beauty of the flower-like polyp.</p>

<p>Structurally, this polyp is closely allied to the common
forms of the Sea Anemones; the most obvious
peculiarity being, that a multitude are combined into
one mass, with a common life animating the whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The fleshy mass is of a spongy texture, full of branching
water-canals, and containing a multitude of calcareous
spicula of characteristic forms. They resemble
gnarled branches of oak, with the branchlets broken
off, leaving ragged ends. The skin of the polyps contains,
at certain fixed spots, groups of similar spicula,
but much more minute. The microscope is necessary
to discern these, as well as some other details of the
organization of this very interesting creature.</p>

<p>The technical character by which this animal with
its allies is distinguished from the proper Anemones, is
that its plan of organization is fashioned on the number
<i>eight</i>, whereas the true Anemones have <i>six</i>, as their
characteristic number. Thus, however numerous the
tentacles of an anemone may be,&mdash;and in the case of
the Daisy or the Plumose, they often amount to several
hundreds,&mdash;the young animal began with six, and the
increase is normally a multiplication of six, though
accidental irregularities do occur. On the other hand,
the tentacles of the Alcyonium are permanently eight,
as are the vertical partitions of the interior of the body;
and by consequence, the chambers into which those
membranous partitions divide it.</p>

<p>But we must not allow the interest attaching to these
forms to divert our attention from the Anemones themselves.
All the species which we saw on the rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
above the water, are here below it, and all displaying
their beauties in an incomparably more charming
fashion. We can compare the whole submerged wall
to nothing else than a parterre of most brilliant flowers,
taken bodily and set on end. The eye is bewildered
with their number and variety, and knows not which
to look at first. Here are the Rosy Anemones,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> with a
firm fleshy column of rich sienna-brown, paler towards
the base, and with the upper part studded with indistinct
spots, marking the situation of certain organs
which have an adhesive power. The disk is of a pale
neutral tint, with a crimson mouth in the centre, and
a circumference of crowded tentacles of the most lovely
rose-purple, the rich hue of that lovely flower that
bears the name of General Jacqueminot. In those
specimens that are most widely opened, this tentacular
fringe forms a blossom whose petals overhang the concealed
column, expanding to the width of an inch or
more; but there are others in which the expansion is
less complete in different degrees, and these all give
distinct phases of loveliness. We find a few among the
rest, which, with the characteristically-coloured tentacles,
have the column and the disk of a creamy white;
and one in which the disk is of a brilliant orange, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>clining
to scarlet. Most lovely little creatures are
they all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCARLET-FRINGED ANEMONE.</div>

<p>Commingled with these charming Roses, there are
others which attain a larger size, occurring in even
greater abundance. They are frequently an inch and
a half in diameter when expanded, and some are even
larger than this. You may know them at once by
observing that the outer row of tentacles, and occasionally
also some of the others, are of a scarlet hue,
which, when examined minutely, is seen to be produced
by a sort of core of that rich hue pervading the pellucid
tentacle. The species is commonly known as the
Scarlet-fringed Anemone.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The inner rows of tentacles,
which individually are larger than those of the outer
rows, are pale, marked at the base with strong bars of
black. The disk is very variable in hue, but the column
is for the most part of the same rich brown as we saw
in the Rosy. Yet, though these are characteristic
colours, there are specimens which diverge exceedingly
from them, and some approach so near the Roses, as to
be scarcely distinguishable from them. Generally, however,
the scarlet-cored outer tentacles, and a peculiar
habit of throwing the tentacular margin of the disk into
crumpled folds, will be found sufficient to determine this
very handsome kind of Anemone from its nearest allies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PLUMOSE ANEMONE.</div>

<p>There are multitudes too of a charming little kind,
which, on account of the pure whiteness of the crown
of tentacles, is known as the Snowy.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The disk is of
the same spotless hue; and the column of a light drab
deepening into pale olive towards the summit. With
the exception of its colours, this species has a very
close resemblance to the Rosy, with which it is generally
associated, even as we see it here. And here is the
Orange-disk,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> one of exceeding loveliness, which you
might fancy a cross-breed between the Rosy and the
Snowy, having the rich brown column of the former, and
the white tentacles of the latter; but that it has a
character of its own in the disk being of the most
brilliant orange-red. All these are scattered in the
most abundant profusion, looking like gems sown on
the rough rock; or, as I compared them before, like
gorgeous composite flowers, of which you might easily
fancy the little tufts of green and purple <i>Algæ</i> to be
the proper leaves. There are also others, less conspicuous,
the Daisy, the Sandalled, the Cave-dweller,
the Translucent,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> more or less numerously mingled with
the rest, of which I have not space here to speak, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>whose history I have elsewhere written in detail.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And
we see here and there, for the most part crowded into
groups, another interesting kind, the Plumose,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> which
differs much in appearance from its associates, having
a taller column much more pellucid, and a crown of
tentacles so short, so numerous and so dense, as to form
a large confused tuft of frills, which cannot be separated
into rows. This kind is always of self-colours, which,
however, may be light olive, fawn-brown, orange, flesh-colour,
or pure white. Those which the tide has left
exposed, loll out of their holes and droop; but under
the water they stand erect, with a noble boldness.
Each group generally contains individuals of all sizes,
and may be considered as a single family of several
generations, or, to speak more correctly, of several series
of offsets, of different ages. For it is highly characteristic
of this species to increase by spontaneous division.
When a large individual has been a good while adherent
to one spot, and at length chooses to change its quarters,
it does so by causing its base to glide slowly along the
surface on which it rests;&mdash;the glass side of the tank,
for instance. But it frequently happens that small
irregular fragments of the edge of the base are left
behind, as if their adhesion had been so strong, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the animal found it easier to tear its own tissues apart
than to overcome it. The fragments so left soon contract
become smooth, and spherical or oval in outline;
and in the course of a week or fortnight each may be
seen furnished with a margin of tentacles and a disk;
transformed, in fact, into perfect though minute Anemones.
Occasionally a separated piece, more irregularly
jagged than usual, will, in contracting, constringe itself,
and form two smaller fragments, united by an isthmus,
which goes on attenuating until a fine thread-like line
only is stretched from one to the other; this at length
yields, the substance of the broken thread is rapidly
absorbed into the respective pieces, which soon become
two young Anemones.</p>

<p>All the kinds which we have seen in this locality
belong to one great family, the <i>Sagartiadæ</i>, a group
which includes nearly one-third of the seventy species
of Anemones and Corals which we have on the British
coast; and certainly the most beautiful and the most
known, taking them one with another. They are
distinguished by a remarkable peculiarity; the skin of
the body is pierced with minute holes, capable of being
opened and closed at will, out of which can be forced
curious slender threads, which ordinarily lie coiled up
in great profusion in the interior of the animal. These
threads are almost entirely composed of those extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
capsules, called <i>cnidæ</i>, or nettling-cells, found
indeed in most of the tissues, but nowhere in such
abundance as here, which eject with amazing force a
poisonous filament having the strength and elasticity
of a wire, and furnished with reversed barbs, but of
almost inconceivable tenuity. The filaments, projected
by myriads at the pleasure of the animal, penetrate
deeply into the flesh of other soft-bodied creatures, and
cause immediate paralysis and speedy death.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DAHLIA WARTLET.</div>

<p>The waning day and the turning tide warn us homeward;
but we shall have time to visit a fine dark
overarched pool in the rocks which I know on our
route. Here it is; noticeable because of its being the
chosen residence of a colony of that magnificent species,
the Dahlia Wartlet.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> All round the curving sides of
the sea-washed basin, crowding one upon the other
beneath the projecting angles, or seated in single majesty
on some prominence, we see them flaunting the most
gorgeous colours, and attaining a diameter of expanse
that no other, at least of our common forms, can rival
or approach. The wide but low column, rough with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
coarse warts, may be olive, or deep green, or purple-crimson,
or light green splashed and streaked with
scarlet like an apple; the disk is equally varied, but
generally displays diverging bands of rich red which
fork and embrace the tentacles; while the tentacles,
short, stout, and conical, may be white with pellucid
rings, deep crimson, or of the highest flush of rose, with
a broad ring of lilac. Widely expanded, the Crassicornis
is as good a mimicry of the great dahlias of our
gardens, as the Sagartiæ are of the daisies and pompone
chrysanthemums. Even bees are occasionally deceived.
Mr. Couch, when once looking at a fine specimen which
was expanded so close to the surface that only a thin
film of water covered the disk and tentacles, saw a
roving bee alight on the tempting surface, evidently
mistaking the anemone for a veritable blossom; the
tenacious tentacles instantly seized it, and though it
struggled a good deal for its liberty, retained the disappointed
bee till it was drowned, when it was soon
consigned to the insatiable stomach. The story reminds
us of the well-known fact that the flesh-flies, deceived
by the carrion smell of some of the Stapeliæ, sometimes
lay their eggs on the flowers; both cases showing
that animal instinct is not quite so unerring as it is
frequently represented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCERNARIA.</div>

<p>Attached to the thin crumpled leaf of an Ulva in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
this pool is an animal, having much of the texture, and
somewhat of the form, of an Anemone. Formerly, indeed,
it was associated in the same group, but it is
now ascertained to have more affinities with the translucent
and often colourless free-swimming jelly-fishes.
From its resemblance to an elegant lamp, it is called
<i>Lucernaria</i>.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> We must suppose a <i>Medusa</i> to be turned
hollow upwards, and an adhesive foot to be produced
from what was before the summit of its “umbrella;”
and little more is necessary to constitute a <i>Lucernaria</i>.
The most observable peculiarity is that the tentacles,
which are very minute, and have the form of a globose
head seated on a short stem, are disposed in compact
groups of as many as seventy, which groups, eight in
number, like so many round balls, are seated on projecting
angles of the margin; while from the centre of
the hollow rises a mouth, with four protrusile lips in
form of a square. The colour is a dull dark red or
liver brown. The animal preys on other creatures,
which it captures by means of poison-capsules, and
swallows, much as the anemones do.</p>

<p>And thus we wend our way homeward; meditating
much as we glide across the smooth bay, on the wondrous
elegance of form, the exquisite brilliance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
colours, the great variety, the instincts, the powers, the
most elaborate apparatus, bestowed on these humble
creatures, of no apparent use whatever to man; indeed,
until quite recently, utterly neglected by him and unknown,
though exhibiting their loveliness under his
very eyes, and close to his doors. We meditate on
these things, and ask, For what purpose is all this profuse
expenditure of power, wisdom, taste, skill? We
hear the answer in the choral praise of those who know
more of these matters than we can yet attain to,&mdash;“Thou
hast created all things, and <i>for thy pleasure</i> they
are, and were created.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV.<br />

APRIL.</h2>


<p>Shall we explore the sands to-day? A bright sandy
beach well exposed to the sea is no bad hunting-ground
for the naturalist, bare as it looks, and proverbial as is
its character for sterility,&mdash;“barren as the sand on the
sea-shore.” And specially is it likely to be productive,
when, as is often the case, the wide reach of yellow
sand is interrupted by one or more isolated areas of
rough rocks. Goodrington Sands, lying in the hollow
of Torbay, afford just these conditions; and thither will
we bend our steps this April morning.</p>

<p>So we make our way along the dusty highroad, that
leads from Torquay southward, skirting the shore, now
and then getting peeps of the rocks and the retiring
tide, over the massive sea-walls, as the successive coves
open and again shut-in by bounding hedgerows as we
cross the bases of the intervening headlands. Wild
hyacinths are peeping among the rank foliage of the
arums and nettles; and harts-tongue ferns, and prim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>roses
are everywhere, clustering in great masses, or
studding the green banks in single stars; the bright
rose-campion smiles, and the ever lovely germander
speedwell, brightest, sweetest of spring flowers, gladdens
us here and there, like “angels’ eyes,” as our rustics
poetically call these pretty azure flowers.</p>

<p>As we proceed, we pause to wipe our foreheads, and
turning round, see Torquay behind us, covering and
crowning its amphitheatre of hills, like a queenly city,
surely the most beauteous of all our watering-places;&mdash;and
beyond it on the left, we see the old church tower
of Marychurch, on its elevated plateau, standing out
massive and dark against the sky.</p>

<p>We pass through the outskirts of the long straggling
village of Paignton, and mark how picturesquely it is
embosomed in the midst of its apple orchards; the old-fashioned
cottages buried in the trees, so that only the
time-stained roofs of brown thatch rise here and there,
like islets in a wide sea of blushing blossom. And
now extensive osier grounds lie on either side; the
young tender-green shoots, the hope of the harvest,
rising thickly from the uncouth pollard stumps;
while the still water glimmers everywhere around
their roots.</p>

<p>A narrow lane leads off abruptly on our left, into
which we turn, and in a moment are in a mossy, flowery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
ferny region. The open gate of a villa reveals a little
girl “perambulating” a baby amid the bowers and
blossoms of a sweet garden, whose numerous old tamarisk
trees, rough and bristling, guard the wall, just
breaking into their plumy foliage. And then we open
the expanse of shore and sea, and the wheels of the
carriage are suddenly six inches deep in the soft sand.
How brightly the wide silver sea is glancing and sparkling
under the climbing sun! Scarcely a breeze breaks
its mirrory face, though far out in the offing lines and
bands of deep blue show that there are intermitting
puffs ruffling the water; and the craft that creep along
the horizon have evidently got a working breeze, though
the yachts in the half-distance sit like white swans, their
motionless prows pointing every way, and “floating
double,” on the molten looking-glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOODRINGTON SANDS.</div>

<p>These are the Goodrington Sands; for there on the
left is the projecting bluff of red sandstone, horizontally
stratified, known as Roundham Head, and beyond it in
the distance we see Hope’s Nose, and its two guardian
islets, the Orestone and the Thatcher. On the other
side, the long wall of land terminating in Berry Head
projects to an equal distance, and we are in the bottom
of the deep bight, nearly equidistant from both.</p>

<p>Immediately in front of the debouchure of the little
green lane, beginning some way down the beach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
stretching away into the sea, there is a mass of low
black rock, leprous with barnacles, and draped with
ragged tufts of oar-weed and tangle and bladder-wrack,
sweltering and blackening in the sun. It is much
broken up, and narrow winding lanes paved with sand
pierce it in all directions; and shallow pools of quiet
water sleep everywhere in the hollows. Sweet little
sea-gardens are these pools: bright green leaves of
ulva float like tinted cambric in the water; tufts of
chondrus are glittering with steely reflections of gemmeous
blue; large broad leaves of dulse, richly, darkly
red, afford fine contrasts with the green sea-lettuce;
and one and all give ample shelter to thousands of
vigilant, busy, happy, living creatures. It is treacherous
walking; for the footing is very uneven, and the glare
of the sun on the water renders it difficult to see where
to tread; while the advance and recess of the wavelets
on the sand between, give to the bewildered brain the
impression that everything is sliding from under the
foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAIGNTON COCKLE.</div>

<p>What is that object that lies on yonder stretch of
sand, over which the shallow water ripples, washing the
sand around it and presently leaving it dry? It looks
like a stone; but there is a fine scarlet knob on it;
which all of a sudden has disappeared. Let us watch
the moment of the receding wave, and run out to it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
It is a fine example of the great spinous cockle,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> for
which all these sandy beaches that form the bottom of
the great sea-bend of Torbay are celebrated. Indeed
the species is scarcely known elsewhere; so that it is
often designated in books as the Paignton cockle. A
right savoury <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bouche</i> it is, when artistically dressed.
Old Dr. Turton, a great authority in his day for Devonshire
natural history, especially in matters relating to
shells and shell-fish, says that the cottagers about
Paignton well know the “red noses,” as they call the
great cockles, and search for them at the low spring-tides,
when they may be seen lying in the sand with
the fringed siphons appearing just above the surface.
They gather them in baskets and panniers, and after
cleansing them a few hours in cold spring-water, fry
the animals in a batter made of crumbs of bread. The
creatures have not changed their habits nor their habitats;
for they are still to be seen in the old spots just
as they were a century ago: nor have they lost their
reputation; they are indeed promoted to the gratification
of more refined palates now, for the cottagers,
knowing on which side their bread is buttered, collect
the sapid cockles for the fashionables of Torquay, and
content themselves with the humbler and smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
species,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> which rather affects the muddy flats of estuaries
than sand beaches, though not uncommon here.
This latter, though much inferior in sapidity to the great
spinous sort, forms a far more important item in the
category of human food, from its very general distribution,
its extreme abundance, and the ease with which
it is collected. Wherever the receding tide leaves an
area of exposed mud, the common cockle is sure to be
found; and hundreds of men, women, and children,
may be seen plodding and groping over the stinking
surface, with naked feet and bent backs, picking up the
shell-fish by thousands, to be boiled and eaten for home
consumption, or to be cried through the lanes and alleys
of the neighbouring towns by stentorian boys, who vociferate
all day long,&mdash;“Here’s your fine cockles, here!
Here they are! Here they are! Twopence a quart!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">COCKLE-FISHING.</div>

<p>It is on the north-western coasts of Scotland, however,
that the greatest abundance of these mollusca
occurs, and there they form not a luxury, but even a
necessary of life to the poor semi-barbarous population.
The inhabitants of those rocky regions enjoy an unenviable
notoriety for being habitually dependent on this
mean diet. “Where the river meets the sea at Tongue,”
says Macculloch, “there is a considerable ebb, and the
long sand-banks are productive of cockles in an abund<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ance
which is almost unexampled. At that time (a year
of scarcity) they presented every day at low water a
singular spectacle, being crowded with men, women,
and children, who were busily employed in digging for
these shell-fish as long as the tide permitted. It was
not unusual also to see thirty or forty horses from the
surrounding country, which had been brought down for
the purpose of carrying away loads of them to distances
of many miles. This was a well-known season of
scarcity, and, without this resource, I believe it is not
too much to say, that many individuals must have died
for want.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The isles of Barra and North Uist, in the Hebrides,
possess also enormous resources of the same character.
“It is not easy to calculate,” says Mr. Wilson, “the
amount of such beds of shell-fish, but we may mention
that, during a period of great distress which prevailed a
good many years ago, all the families in the island (then
about two hundred in number) resorted, for the sake of
this food, to the great sands at the northern end of
Barra. It was computed that, for a couple of summers
at the time alluded to, no less than from one hundred
to two hundred horse-loads were taken at low water
every day of the spring-tides during the months of
May, June, July, and August. We were pleased to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
hear it observed that the shell-fish are always most
abundant in years of scarcity.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>These Barra beds are of great antiquity. A very old
writer, Dean Monro, thus notices them:&mdash;“This ile is
full of grate cokills, and alledgit be the auncient countrymen
that the same cokills comes down out of the foresaid
hill throw the said strype in the first smalle forme
that wee have spokyn of, and aftir theyr comying down
to the sandes growis grate cokills allways. Ther is
no fayrer and more profytable sandes for cokills in all
the worlde.”</p>

<p>But all this time our fair “cokill” has been lying
at our feet, snapping, and gaping, and thrusting forth
and back his great coral foot, waiting our leisure to
take him up. No longer shall he be neglected. The
bivalve shell is a fine solid house of stone, massive,
strong, and heavy, elegantly fluted with prominent
ribs that radiate regularly on both valves from the
curved beaks, which ribs are beset with polished spiny
points. The hues of the shell are attractive, though
not at all showy; they consist of tints of yellowish and
reddish browns, rich and warm, arranged in concentric
bands, and gradually fading to a creamy white at the
beaks. Unlike the scallops, the cockles have the two
valves alike in shape, and from the bent beaks meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
each other, and the curvature of the outline, they present,
when viewed endwise, a very regular and beautiful
heart-shape, whence the scientific name of the genus is
derived, <i>Cardium</i>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρδία</span>, the heart.</p>

<p>The animal which inhabits this strong fortress is
handsomer than bivalves usually are. The leaves of
the mantle are thick and convex, corresponding to the
shell-valves; the edges are strongly fringed in the
neighbourhood of the siphons, which are short tubes of
considerable diameter, soldered, as it were, together.
The mantle has a soft spongy character towards its
edges, but towards the back, where it lines the valves,
it is very thin and almost membranous. The hue of
the former parts is very rich, a fine brilliant orange,
with the shaggy fringe of tentacles paler; the siphons
are also orange, with the inner surface of the tubes
white, having a pearly gleam.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOOT OF THE COCKLE.</div>

<p>But what was that scarlet knob that we saw protruded
and retracted but now? Ha! as it lies, slightly
gaping, the lips of the mantle recede, and we catch a
peep within of the gorgeous colour. Suddenly the
valves open to their full extent, like the folding doors
of a drawing-room, allowing exit to a richly dressed
lady. Here comes the vermilion tenant! Place for my
lady! But what is she? And what is she about to do
in her gorgeous raiment? Nay; ’tis but the cockle’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
foot; a monopod he is: this is all the foot he has. It
is clad in neither shoe nor stocking; and truly it needs
it not. Never was the silken-hosed foot of cardinal
arrayed like this. But see to what an extent the organ
protrudes! four inches from the valves’ edges does its
tip reach; smooth, lubricous, taper, with a knee at the
upper part, and the toe bent in the form of a hook. As
to its general appearance when thus extended, I have
compared it to a finger of polished carnelian; but Mr.
Kingsley thinks that this resemblance will not hold, the
foot being too opaque for that gem: he likens it to a
long capsicum, which is, however, too dull and too dark;
and he tells a story of a certain (mythic, I fear) countess
who, seeing it for the first time, exclaimed, “Oh, dear!
I always heard that my pretty red coral came out of a
fish, and here it is, all alive!”</p>

<p>Nay; after all, it is what it is; and those comparisons
just help one who has never seen it, to form some
conception of its appearance; but by one who has, all
will be rejected as inadequate.</p>

<p>And as to what the brilliant organ is going to do,
that we see. For the long taper foot being thrust to its
utmost, feels about for some resisting surface, that stone,
half buried in the sand, for instance; which no sooner
does it feel than the hooked point is pressed stiffly
against it, the whole foot by muscular contraction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
made suddenly rigid, and the entire creature,&mdash;mantle,
siphons, foot, shell and all&mdash;is jerked away in an uncouth
manner, “quite permiscous,” as the fisherman
hard-by says, to a distance of some foot or more. But
the cockle can leap on occasion much more vigorously;
one has been seen to throw itself clear over the gunwale
of a boat when laid on the bottom-boards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS BURROWING FUNCTION.</div>

<p>Thus we see one use of the hooked tip is to afford a
stronger spring; but it has a more direct bearing on
the burrowing habits of the animal. Like all the rest
of its beautiful tribe, this species is a dweller in the
deep sand, into which it can penetrate with considerable
power and rapidity. In order to do this, the foot
is straightened, and the sharp point is thrust perpendicularly
down into the wet sand. The muscular force
exerted is sufficient to penetrate the soft sand to the
whole length, when the point is suddenly bent sidewise,
thus obtaining a strong holdfast. The whole organ is
now strongly contracted in length, and the animal and
shell are dragged forcibly to the mouth of the burrow,
the edges of the valves downward and piercing the sand
a little way. The straightened point is then pushed an
inch or two farther down; again hooked, and another
pull is made. The shell descends a little farther into
the yielding sand, and the same interchange of processes
goes on till the animal is sufficiently buried. To read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
this description you would suppose it a most clumsy,
and ineffective, and slow business; but indeed this is
very far from its character. The elongations and contractions
are made with great rapidity; and almost
with the quickness of thought the unwieldy cockle,
when in full vigour and thoroughly alarmed, disappears
into his sandy fortress; so fast, indeed, that you must
be very alert to overtake him and prevent his descent,
if you have no appliances but your two hands.</p>

<p>Cuvier, in his elaborate and beautiful dissections of
the Mollusca, has demonstrated that this important
organ is mainly composed of an immense multitude of
muscles, circular, longitudinal, and transverse, wonderful
in their complexity and arrangement, but most
perfectly adapted to impart variety, force, and precision
to its movements. In these respects the human tongue
perhaps presents the closest parallel to its organization.
It is remarkable that at its upper or basal part it is
hollow, and encloses some of the viscera of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANDED VENUS.</div>

<p>Here, under this low-lying ledge of rock, is another
shell, which in beauty perhaps excels even the gorgeous
cockle. It belongs to a genus pre-eminent for loveliness,
to which the name of the Goddess of Love has
been assigned. This is the Banded Venus.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
prominent and obvious character is that the shell-valves
are covered with ribs, more or less strongly marked,
which, instead of running fan-like from the beaks to the
edges, as in the cockles, are concentric, being parallel
with the edges. In this species these ribs are well
marked, about a dozen in number, broad, flat, sharply
defined, and nearly equally distant. They impart to the
shell, which is very convex, and nearly round, an aspect
of great strength combined with elegance. The colours,
too, are very ornamental: broad bands of brownish
lilac, varied with warmer tints, widening as they go,
radiate from the beaks to the margins, relieved by a
whitish ground. The hues vary in different individuals;
the bands being sometimes rusty brown, or purple;
and the ground yellow, or pale orange; and the contrasts
are in some better marked than in others; but
when fresh and unrubbed the shell is always a beautiful
one.</p>

</div>

<p>The specimen before us is alive. I will drop it into
this shallow pool in the rock. See, the valves are
opening, and a large foot of a waxy whiteness, almost
semi-pellucid, protrudes, thicker and more ovate than
that of the cockle, but not capable of such elongation.
The siphons, however, are proportionally longer; they
are separate at their extremities, and project considerably
from the shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>But while we are gazing at the beauty of our little
Venus, we become cognizant of the presence of another
spectator. He has slowly come out from beneath the
shadow of that long dark-brown leaf of <i>Laminaria</i>, that
floats like a crumpled ribbon across the pool, and now
rests on the tuft of <i>Iridæa</i>, that fine scarlet weed of
leathery texture, that grows in the shaded corner. It is
a Prawn;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and a fellow of noble dimensions. Is he too
attracted by the fair shell? or rather is not his attention
occupied by us? Yes; the latter is the true case;
as you may discern by his long-stalked eyes, steadily
staring upwards. He wonders what our two faces can
mean; and, as we remain still, he ventures forth to
take a fuller view.</p>

COMMON SHRIMP. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  GREAT PRAWN.
</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRAWN’S ARMS.</div>

<p>An elegant creature is the common prawn, or rock-shrimp,
as the fishermen designate him, by way of distinction
from another sapid crustacean that inhabits
these shores. His armour of proof, composed of plates
that slide so smoothly one under another, sustains the
most lustrous polish, and is ever subject to the animal’s
efforts to keep it so; for, whenever he has a moment’s
leisure from more pressing avocations, he is constantly
engaged in cleaning it with the brushes which those
slender fore-limbs of his carry. Like a true soldier, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a knight of chivalry, the Prawn lives, eats, sleeps in
armour. How completely is his body encased in defensive
mail; and he carries his tempered weapon too.
Look at the serrate sword which he always points at the
foe whom he faces! Who would rashly provoke such
a weapon as this? Stiff and firm in substance, long,
pointed, two-edged, keen on both edges, curved sabre-like,
and cut into acute teeth; it does seem a most
formidable affair: and yet, truth to tell, I do not know
what use the owner makes of it. Though I have been
for many years in the practice of keeping these elegant
animals in my aquaria, I have never seen one smite a
foe with his two-edged sword. Perhaps like the cane
over the looking-glass in a nursery, its mere presence is
sufficient to keep in awe encroaching enemies, whose
hearts sink when they behold the sharp-toothed weapon.</p>

<p>Exquisitely painted is the Prawn. His ground colour
is semi-pellucid olive-grey, on which transverse lines of
black are drawn; and specks and dashes of sparkling
white, symmetrically arranged and well defined, are
scattered here and there, especially upon the broad
swimming plates that serve as his principal instruments
of locomotion. His limbs, too, are ringed with blue and
orange, a felicitous combination!</p>

<p>I have just alluded to the tail as a motive power. It
is a very curious organ, consisting of five plates, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
hinged that they can play over each other, or be spread
out in shape of a fan, and each plate beset on its edges
with a most delicate fringe of stiff bristles. To see its
use, you have only to approach the animal. He instantly
darts away with force; all the while, however, keeping
his face to the foe, as becomes a soldier so armed. Now
this retrocessive power is his great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheval de bataille</i>.
When gently exploring, he crawls among the weeds on
the tips of his long feet; when swimming at ease, he
glides gracefully along by the rapid paddling of the false
feet, of which he carries five pairs beneath his abdomen.
But when alarmed, he forcibly throws forward this plated
tail, expanded to the utmost, bending the last joints of
the body from the hump on his back, and thus strikes
a powerful forward blow on the water, by the impact of
which the whole prawn is jerked backward to a distance
of several inches.</p>

<p>But he is gone; and it were useless to look for him
any more in this wilderness of sea-weeds, and amid the
cavernous recesses of those rocky ledges, where he enjoys
ample means of retreat and concealment. For,
even if you did catch a momentary glimpse of him again,
it would be only as he darts from one shelter to another,
and he would presently be far out of your reach in the
obscurity of some inexplorable hole.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the beach and follow the water’s edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Let us see what this fisherman is so busy about, and
what that horse is doing as he paces backward and
forward belly-deep in the sea, from one end of the
beach to the other, then retracing his steps, as if he
were ploughing the shallows. And why does the fisherman
watch the horse so attentively? Hark! what says
he? He shouts to the diminutive urchin that rides the
horse to come in; and now he eagerly goes down to the
edge of the sea, as the beast and his little rider come
ashore. We will go and see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEER-DRAG.</div>

<p>The man is civil and communicative, and lets us into
the whole secret; though now indeed that we are on the
spot, it is sufficiently patent. The horse draws behind
him an implement called a keer-drag; a net, which is
stretched upon an oblong iron frame, that forms its
mouth. Behind, the net tapers to a point, but is left
open there in the making, and only tied with a string.
The iron frame keeps the net-mouth open, and being
attached by a bridle to a rope, which is fastened to the
horse’s harness, scrapes the sea-bottom as he proceeds;
whatever is collected passing into the net, and accumulating
at the narrow point.</p>

<p>Now the shallows just here are alive with swarms of
another edible species of crustacea, the Shrimp,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> <i>par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
excellence</i>; or, as the people here say, the sand shrimp,
to distinguish it from the prawn, which, as I have observed,
they call the rock shrimp. And this sand
shrimp finds a ready sale in the Torquay market; the
fisherman getting, as he tells us, a shilling a quart from
the fishmongers.</p>

<p>The horse, doubtless nothing loath, for his toil must
be great, wading on soft sand in three feet of water, and
dragging that heavy apparatus behind him, walks to
dry land, where, as soon as the keer-drag is ashore, the
man seizes it, cries “whow!” to the obedient animal,
and, having spread a cloth on the sand, proceeds to untie
the string, and pour out on the cloth the struggling
contents. “It is a very good haul,” says the fellow;
“there’s more nor two quart there!” So, being in a
good humour, and naturally civil besides, we venture
to propound a bargain; that, for a small coin of the
realm, we may be allowed to pick out all the “rubbish;”
<i>i.e.</i>, everything that is not a shrimp, and convey it to
our own private reservoirs; a pleasant agreement for
both parties; for the net gathers many curious creatures
of great interest to the naturalist, though of no value
whatever to the fisherman. Shrimps, however, are the
staple; there are probably a hundred of these to one of
all other kinds, lumping these latter all together. And
very fine these shrimps are. Mr. Bell gives two inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and a half as the total length of the species,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and I do
not remember that I ever before saw one that exceeded
that size: but here, the great majority are upwards of
three inches; and a very considerable number are full
three and a half. They are mostly females loaded with
spawn, which they carry entangled among the false
feet beneath the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHRIMP.</div>

<p>In general figure the shrimp resembles the prawn:
it, however, carries no sword-like rostrum; and the
front pair of feet, instead of terminating each in a pair
of claws, have a strong hook which bends down upon
a short spine. The limbs too are very much shorter,
and the animal is less elegant. The colour is a pale
warm brown; but when examined closely this is seen
to resolve itself into a freckling of black, grey, brown,
and orange specks, arranged so as to make a kaleidoscopic
sort of pattern. When highly magnified many
of the dots take star-like forms.</p>

<p>It is amusing to see how rapidly and cleverly the
shrimp takes its place in the sand. If there be an
inch or two’s depth of water, the animal quietly sinks
on the bottom; then, in a moment, you see a little
cloud of dust (so it seems) rise up along each side, and
the body sinks till the surrounding surface is nearly
level with its back. Then you perceive the value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
peculiar style of colouring: the freckling of specks of
various tints of brown, grey, and red, so exactly resembles
the hues of the sand, that you might look close
at a shrimp so sunken, and yet not discern it. The
eyes, however, which are set on the top of the head,
like a Dutchman’s garret windows, are keeping a bright
watch upward, and here it lies, quiet and, against most
enemies, safe. The iron lip of the drag, however, scrapes
up with its edge the upper inch of sand-bottom, routs
out the poor shrimps, which dart upwards, to find themselves
within the mouth of the ever-advancing net.
The agency in the burrowing is the false feet, which,
waved rapidly to and fro, brush up the fine sand with
the currents that they make in the water, and throw it
up in those clouds on each side, presently to fall again
on the body, and help to conceal it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLAT-FISHES.</div>

<p>But there are more things than shrimps in the gleaming,
working, struggling mass of life before us. Not to
mind the uncouth soldier-crabs, dragging about their
despoiled shells, which, numerous and conspicuous as
they are, we shall neglect for another occasion,&mdash;we
have other fish to fry. Here are sundry examples of
that remarkable race, the proper Flat-fishes. These
thin, brown, long-oval ones are specimens of Soles, of
which there are two kinds here, the Common Sole,
uniform dull brown, and the Lemon Sole, of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
freckled tint, pale orange brown, with darker spots.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The fisherman considers them marketable if they are
not less than four or five inches long, and bundles them
into his common depository, under the title of tea-dabs,
a name which sufficiently indicates their destiny.</p>

<p>Now every one has looked at hundreds of pairs of
soles raw and ready, but perhaps not all have ever adequately
remarked the singular anomaly presented by
their structure, or are aware how unique their tribe is
among animals. That one surface is positively coloured,
while the other is fleshy white, is no great matter; for
many creatures, and fishes in particular, are darker
above and paler below. The flat Rays are equally abject,
and show a like contrast of hues; but, <i>structurally</i>,
the colours in the Sole are not respectively on the back
and belly, though they are certainly above and below.
These fishes, in fact, swim and lie <i>on one side</i>; and so
they have one side dark and one side light.</p>

<p>This habit, however, imposed upon them, involves
other very important aberrations from ordinary forms.
Let us suppose that the eyes had been placed, like
those of the Chætodons (very thin, wide, and flat fishes
of the tropical seas), one on each side of the head. That
eye which belonged to the white or inferior side, would
be rendered useless, since it would be almost perpe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>tually
buried in the mud of the bottom. Hence, by an
unprecedented exception to the symmetry which marks
the organs of sense in all other vertebrate animals, both
of the eyes are placed on the same side of the head,
one above the other. They are, however, frequently
not in the same line, and one is often smaller and less
developed than the other.</p>

<p>In addition to these peculiarities, we may remark,
that the spine makes a sudden twist near the head to
one side; that the bones of the head are not symmetrical;
that the two sides of the mouth are unequal; that
the pectoral and ventral fins of the under side are generally
smaller than those of the upper; and that the
dorsal and anal fins generally correspond to each other,
the one fringing the whole length of the dorsal, the
other that of the ventral edge of the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">YARRELL ON FLAT-FISHES.</div>

<p>We must not suppose that these peculiarities are
defects and mistakes; nor, like Buffon, when he found
some structure or habit which was at variance with
his preconceived notions of fitness, accuse the all-wise
God of bungling in His work. They are merely examples
of that inscrutable wisdom, those inexhaustible
resources of power and skill, which can and often do
delight to attain the most worthy ends by the most unexpected
roads, in which we can only follow, as the
way is opened up to us, and wonderingly adore. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
us hear what Yarrell says on these strange modifications.
“The Flat-fishes ... are, by this depressed
form of body, admirably adapted to inhabit the lowest
position, and where they occupy the least space, among
their kindred fishes. Preferring sandy or muddy shores,
and unprovided with swimming-bladders, their place
is close to the ground, where, hiding their bodies horizontally
in the loose soil at the bottom, with the head
only slightly elevated, an eye on the under side of the
head would be useless; but both eyes placed on the
upper surface afford them an extensive range of view
in those various directions in which they may either
endeavour to find suitable food, or avoid dangerous
enemies. Light, one great cause of colour, strikes on
the upper surface only; the under surface, like that of
most other fishes, remains perfectly colourless. Having
little or no means of defence, had their colour been
placed only above the lateral line on each side, in
whatever position they moved, their piebald appearance
would have rendered them conspicuous objects to
all their enemies. When near the ground they swim
slowly, maintaining their horizontal position; and the
smaller pectoral and ventral fins on the under side are
advantageous where there is so much less room for their
action, than with the larger fins that are above. When
suddenly disturbed, they sometimes make a rapid shoot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
changing their position from horizontal to vertical; if
the observer happens to be opposite the white side,
they may be seen to pass with the rapidity and flash
of a meteor; but they soon sink down, resuming their
previous motionless, horizontal position, and are then
distinguished with difficulty, owing to their great similarity
in colour to the surface on which they rest.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>On several occasions I have, when examining the
contents of the shrimpers’ nets, found a pretty little
species of flat-fish, which, though we find it not at this
moment, is a pretty constant inhabitant of these sandy
beaches. It is too small and too worthless for the
fisherman to have a distinctive name for it, but our systematic
books call it a Topknot,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and assign to it near
consanguinity with the majestic and delicious turbot.
It is marked as very rare; but I have seen three or
four come up at a haul of the drag, and have found
it among the rocks. Not long ago, I took a specimen
by turning over a flat stone in a sandy pool in this
ledge. It was indeed small, not exceeding an inch and
a half in length; the ordinary size of those that occur
as the shrimps’ companions in captivity; but their
utmost growth scarcely attains five inches.</p>

SAND-LAUNCE. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  TOPKNOT.
</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">TOPKNOT.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>The specimen I allude to I took home, and observed
at leisure. In a white saucer it was a charming little
object, though rather difficult to examine, because, the
instant the eye with the lens was brought near, it
flounced in alarm, and often leaped out upon the table.
When its fit of terror was over, however, it became still,
and would allow me to push it hither and thither,
merely waving the edges of its dorsal and ventral fins
rapidly as it yielded to the impulse. The shape of
these fins gives to the outline of the fish a form resembling
an oblong parallelogram with the corners rounded,
and the fan-like tail projecting; but the outline of the
body is much more oval. The first ray of the dorsal is
a little lengthened; whence the name of Topknot. We
have two little species of Turbot with this peculiarity,
called Muller’s Topknot, and Bloch’s Topknot. This
was the former. Yarrell, indeed, distinguishes the two
by saying that this one has “the first ray of the dorsal
not longer than the succeeding rays;” or, in other
words, that it has no topknot at all. It may be that it
is obliterated in age, but in this half-grown specimen, it
was quite conspicuous, projecting like a little horn from
the forehead, about one-fourth longer than the second
and following rays. In Bloch’s Topknot it is, indeed,
more marked, for it there runs off into a slender filament,
of more than twice the length of the rays. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
fins were exquisitely delicate, and were very pretty in
their markings, every tenth or twelfth ray being black
interrupted with white; the middle ray between these
was black at the tip, and the central one of these subordinate
divisions was again more slightly specked. This
had a very pretty effect. The body was pellucid yellowish
brown, studded with irregular faint clouds and
stronger specks of dark brown, and bearing one conspicuous
ring-like mark near the tail The flesh was so
translucent, that the stomach and principal viscera
could be distinctly seen, and the accumulation of the
chief blood-vessels here, gave a crimson flush to these
parts.</p>

<p>Alarm had a curious effect, probably dependent on
the quickening of the circulation. When I tried to
catch the little fish, all the spots and markings became
instantly deepened and vivified, and particularly those
of the fins, so that the change seemed magical. I have
observed the same thing in the Gobies, and some other
fishes.</p>

<p>The eyes were very beautiful and interesting. As in
all this family of Flat-fishes, they are set close together
on the same side of the head, the upper one inclined
slightly upward, the lower downward. Viewed with a
lens, the iris was seen to be pale green, with radiating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
dark bands, and the pupil surrounded by an edge-line
of ruddy gold. The iris projects into the pupil with an
angle, making it crescent-shaped. The eyes move quite
independently of each other, and very curious it was to
look down with a lens upon the quaint little face, and
see one eye quickly turned up towards the beholder,
while the other remained still, or presently turned in
the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Now and then it curved the head and tail downwards,
and leaped out of water, clearing the side of the
saucer in which it was confined; then, when put back,
it lay some seconds on its back (or rather on its wrong
side), with the dorsal and ventrals incurved, and thus
the whole body concave, as if in tetanus; but when
turned over it soon recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAND-LAUNCE.</div>

<p>What is this writhing, wriggling thing, that looks
like a narrow tape of burnished silver? It is a Sand-launce,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and very slyly is it endeavouring to make its
way down to the rippling edge of the wave, to liberty
and life. But not so fast, pretty Launce! we want to
have a look at you, and to introduce you to a very
jolly set in our aquarium at home. Now don’t flounce
and dart round the jar so angrily: you can’t get out,
and may as well be philosophic.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>Do you see the remarkable projection of the lower
jaws? With that sort of spade the little silvery fish
manages to scoop out a bed for itself very quickly in
the wet sand, and so lie hid. It is numerous enough in
these bays, and it is in request among fishermen, who
use it largely as bait, and who, to obtain it, cast a seine,
and enclose vast multitudes, which are thus dragged up
on the beach high and dry.</p>

<p>A short time ago I saw a paragraph in the <i>Times</i>,
from some Jersey correspondent, who complained of the
recent scarcity of fish, and accounted for it by the following
curious catenation of links. A number of sharks had
recently appeared in the offing, which frightened away
the shoals of porpesses, which ordinarily came to feed
on the fishes, which fed on the Sand-launce. Now
when the porpesses were there the fishes were driven
with the Launce into the shallows, and were readily
taken; but, on being relieved of these persecutors by the
intruding sharks, were free to retire to the deeper water,
where the fishers could less easily entrap them. The
writer stated, however, that at length the sharks had
departed, the porpesses had returned, the fishes were
consequently driven in shore, and were again devouring
the Launce. The whole account has something
of the “House that Jack built” twang, and I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
not quite pin my faith on the philosophy of the explanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LAUNCE IN THE TANK.</div>

<p>Be that as it may, I can vouch for the Launce making
a very attractive tenant of an aquarium, where it
will live a considerable time. The pearly gleams of
lustre from its sides are very beautiful, and such as no
pictorial art can reproduce.</p>

<h2>V.<br />

MAY.</h2>


<p>We are far from having exhausted the treasures of
the teeming sands. Another visit to their broad expanse
may yield other objects of interest not inferior to those
we lately discovered there. Let us, then, seek the
shore, where our humble friend the shrimper, with his
wading horse, under the guidance of his shrill-voiced
little son, still pursues his indefatigable calling.</p>

<p>Again the keer-drag is drawn up the tawny beach,
the bag is untied, and the sparkling, crawling, jumping
heap spreads itself over the sand, beyond the limits of
the insufficient cloth.</p>

<p>A little silvery fish wriggles from the mass, and, by a
few lateral vibrations, in an instant buries himself in
the soft wet sand, all but the upper surface of his head
and back. Our attention is drawn towards this object;
but our friend the shrimper shouts rather abruptly a
note of warning. “Mind what ye be ’bout! that ’ere’s
pison! He’s a sting-bull, he is.” Thus armed, we use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
caution in our approaches, and look well before we
touch. As we see it now, it certainly presents a noteworthy
appearance. A large head, with a wide mouth
opening at very upward angles; two staring eyes, set in
the crown so as to look upward instead of sideways,
and intently watching our intentions; a short fin on
the back, of which the membrane is of the deepest
velvet black, and the rays, which are stout sharp spines,
are white; these rays are now stretched to the utmost,
like a fan widely expanded, so as to offer the threatening
points in all directions to a foe;&mdash;these are all the
features we can discern, except a narrow line of olive
presently lost in the sand, which marks the buried
body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEEVER.</div>

<p>In spite of the good man’s earnest warnings to have
nothing to do with so venomous a creature, we must
contrive to take possession of it for study at home;
and by the aid of our hand-net we find no difficulty in
lifting it and transferring it, an unwilling guest, to a
glass jar of sea-water. We now discern it more fully
and distinctly; though it manifests its indignation at
this tyrannical suspension of the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Act,
by flouncing around the glass, and scattering the water
hither and thither. This wrath, however, gradually
subsides, and our captive philosophically makes up
his mind to his fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the Lesser Weever;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> a name corrupted from the
French, who call it Vive, from the length of time
which the fish will <i>live</i> out of its native element. It
also bears the names of sting-fish, sting-bull, and sea-cat,
among English fishermen; on the shores of the
Mediterranean it bears the title of spider, and the
ancient Romans called it sea-dragon. The specific
names,&mdash;<i>vipera</i> and <i>draco</i>, viper and dragon&mdash;which
are appropriated to this species and another which is
nearly allied to it, make up an extensive list of aliases,
all combining to give this pretty little fish a thoroughly
bad reputation. All these titles point to a habit and
a power possessed by it of inflicting severe wounds,
which without doubt are of a highly inflammatory
character, and are slow and difficult to cure. These
are effected by the rays of the first dorsal fin, which,
as we have just seen, are erected and spread in a way
which indicates a perfect consciousness of their power,
and by certain spines, long and acute, set on the gill-covers,
one on each, pointing backward. These all
are of needle-like sharpness, and are wielded most
effectively. Yarrell tells us that if trod upon, or only
touched, while on the watch, nearly buried in the sand
at the bottom of the water, it strikes with force either
upwards or sideways; and Pennant says that he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
it direct its blows with as much judgment as a fighting
cock. Fishermen hold it in great dread; and the name
of sting-bull is said to be due to its power of piercing
even the proverbial thickness of a bull’s hide.</p>

FIFTEEN-SPINED STICKLEBACK. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   LESSER WEEVER.
</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">VENOM OF ITS SPINES.</div>

<p>Cuvier considers the imputation of venom to the
wounds made by the Weever as a popular error. He
says, “They cannot inject into the wounds they inflict
with their spines any poisonous substance, properly so
called; but, as these spines are very strong and sharp-pointed,
and can no doubt pierce the flesh to a considerable
depth, these wounds, like all others of the same
description, may produce dangerous consequences if
care is not taken to enlarge them, and to allow the
blood to flow; this perhaps, is the most certain, as
the simplest remedy, and much preferable to the
boasted applications of the ancients.”</p>

<p>This is oracular; but it does not appear that the
decision of the great French anatomist was grounded
on any definite experiments. Mr. Couch, on the other
hand, has known three men wounded successively in
the hand by the same fish (the Greater Weever), and the
consequences have been felt in a few minutes as high
as the shoulder. It is certain that the spinous bristles
of certain caterpillars have the power of inflicting
envenomed wounds, which in some cases even prove
fatal, notwithstanding the minuteness of the organs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
and evidence appears very strong for the injection of
some highly irritant poison by means of these prickles
of the Weevers.</p>

<p>The flesh of these fishes is esteemed for the table;
but such is the general apprehension of danger attendant
upon touching them, heightened also by their
great tenacity of life, that the fishermen usually cut off
the first dorsal and the gill-spines as soon as they capture
them; while in Spain and France these precautions are
enforced by legal penalties, on such fishes being exposed
in the market without having been disarmed.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Couch smart friction of the wounded
part with olive-oil is the most effectual remedy; and
this fact again suggests analogy of the evil with the
effects produced by the bites of venomous snakes and
the stings of insects.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Our little fish is not uncomely in its form or the
distribution of its sober colours. The upper parts are
light olive, with lines of ill-defined reddish spots running
lengthwise; the sides are silver-grey, tenderly
washed with blue; the under parts pearly white: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
cheeks and operculum are richly adorned with pearly
reflections; these parts are destitute of scales, which
is the chief distinction between this species and the
Greater Weever, after the size; this species rarely
exceeding five or six inches in length, whereas its
congener attains double those dimensions, and even
more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS HABITS.</div>

<p>In the tank, it is not particularly interesting; it
grovels on the bottom among the pebbles, and will
cover its body with the sediment so far as it is able;
where it lies for hours, watching upward. Doubtless
this is its habitual mode of obtaining its food; lying
motionless in wait, nearly concealed, the eyes and the
mouth both opening upwards, so that the former can
observe, and the latter seize, any vagrant crustacean, or
annelid, or young fish-fry that unsuspectingly swims
within reach. Its motions when its energies are aroused
are rapid, sudden, and forcible; and it probably rarely
misses its victim when it makes its snap; while the
multitude of minute creatures that roam continually
over every part of the sea-bottom give no lack of
opportunities for the exercise of its instincts. He
fares sumptuously, no doubt.</p>

<p>Here is in the drag a specimen of an interesting tribe
of fishes. It is the young of the common Thornback,
a little thing about five inches in width, and in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
infantile grace and beauty much more attractive than
the older ones we are accustomed to see on the fishmonger’s
table. It flaps and flutters in impatience at
being dragged out of its element, and exposed to ungenial
air: we will quiet its anxiety by lifting it
into yonder shallow rock-pool. Now watch it. How
easily and gracefully it glides around its new abode,
moving along by an undulation of the edges of the
broad pectoral fins, a movement which Yarrell describes
as something between flying and swimming. Now it
lies still on the sand-floor of the pool, motionless, save
that the two oval orifices just behind the eyes are
constantly opening and closing, by the drawing across
each or back, of a film which exactly resembles an eyelid,
and which on examination with a lens we see to be
edged with a delicate fringe. The action is so closely
like the winking of an eye, that an observer seeing the
fish for the first time might readily suppose the orifices
to be the organs of vision. They are, however, outlets
of the gills, called spiracles; the ordinary gill-apertures
are five on each side, placed semi-circularly on the
inferior surface of the body, as you see when I turn
the fish on its back, a demonstration which it resents
and resists with all its might: these upper orifices communicate
with the gill-chambers by canals, and you may
see the water now and then strongly driven out of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">YOUNG SKATE.</div>

<p>The eyes are these knobs just in front of the spiracles;
or rather these are the orbits, the pupil looking sideways
and somewhat downward. If you use the lens
again, you perceive that there is a singular protection
to the pupil in the form of a fan-like array of about a
dozen stiff points arching over it.</p>

<p>The general form of the fish is beautifully symmetrical;
it is nearly a rhomboid, with the two front sides slightly
excavated, and the two posterior sides convex. At the
point where these latter unite, there are two smaller fins
(the ventrals), and the body is continued very slender to
a considerable length, tapering to a point, near which
two upright dorsals are placed. The pectorals, as in all
this tribe, are of enormous size, forming the lateral angles
of the rhomboid, and extending in front of the head to
the tip of the snout.</p>

<p>The colours are beautiful, but not at all gaudy. A
warm olive brown is the ground hue, on which numerous
roundish black spots, with softly blending outlines,
are set in symmetrical patterns, and there are also rows
of pale spots. This combination of hues is elegant. The
slender prolongation of the body is edged with a narrow
stripe of pure white. The colour of the whole under
surface is richly iridescent, like mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>At present we see only a few of the curved spines
appearing, chiefly in the vicinity of the eyes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
in the adult become so conspicuous and remarkable;
being something like strong rose-spines, each set on an
oval button of bone, imbedded in the skin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STICKLEBACK.</div>

<p>Another draught presents us with the Fifteen-spined
Stickleback,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> a little fish, remarkable for its form, but
much more so for its habits. It is ordinarily about five
or six inches in length, very slender and lithe, from
which circumstance, combined with a protrusion of the
jaws, which gives it a sinister expression, it is on some
parts of the coast called the Sea-Adder. The lower jaw
projects considerably beyond the upper, which indicates
that the fish habitually takes its food from a point above
the level of its own body. The dorsal and anal fins are
high and short, so as to form, when erected, nearly equal-sided
triangles; but the former is preceded by fifteen
minute sharp erectile spines, each of which has its own
little membrane, and all together represent the spinous
portion of the dorsal fin in such fishes as have but one,
as the Blennies, or the first dorsal in such as have two,
as the Weevers. The caudal is narrowly lozenge-formed,
as ordinarily carried, but becomes fan-like when expanded.
The colours are deep sepia, or olive-brown,
cast into streaks and irregular clouds, on the sides,
where they are interrupted by white, and by a rich
golden yellow, that extends over the inferior surface:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the dorsal and anal fins are white, each crossed by a
broad conspicuous band of brown; the eyes have golden
irides.</p>

<p>We frequently see this attractive little fish hovering
about the long tufts of wrack and tangle that hang from
perpendicular rocks, and from the quays and wharves
of our harbours. It diligently hunts about for its minute
crustacean prey, in picking off which it assumes all varieties
of position “between the horizontal and perpendicular,
with the head downward or upward,” thrusting
its projecting snout into the tufted weed, and snatching
its morsel with a sudden jerk.</p>

<p>It is, however, in its domestic relations that this little
fish presents itself in the most interesting aspect. It
was known ages ago to Aristotle, that some fishes are
in the habit of forming nests, in which they deposit
their eggs, and bring up their young with a parental
care not inferior to that of birds. Until lately, however,
this fact was supposed to be fabulous; and fishes
were believed by the greatest masters of modern zoology
to be utterly destitute of the parental instinct. Recent
research has in this, as in so many instances, proved the
exactitude of the old Stagyrite’s knowledge, and we now
know that several fishes of different families nidificate.
The Sticklebacks, most of which inhabit in common our
marine and fresh waters, are remarkable for the mani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>festation
of this faculty, as was first shown by Mr.
Crookenden, of Lewisham, in 1834, and as has since
been proved, with many interesting details, by Mr. A.
Hancock and Mr. Warington. Our Sea-Adder, which
is exclusively marine, was first ascertained to be a nest-builder
by the late Dr. George Johnston, who mentioned
the fact in the “Transactions of the Berwickshire Naturalists’
Club” in 1839. But the most interesting account
is that of Mr. R. Q. Couch, who noticed the facts
on the coast of Cornwall, and thus records them in
a paper read before the Royal Institution of that
<span class="lock">county:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS NEST.</div>

<p>“During the summers of 1842 and 1843, while
searching for the naked mollusks of the county, I
occasionally discovered portions of sea-weed and the
common coralline (<i>Corallina officinalis</i>) hanging from
the rocks in pear-shaped masses, variously intermingled
with each other. On one occasion, having observed
that the mass was very curiously bound together by a
slender, silken-looking thread, it was torn open, and
the centre was found to be occupied by a mass of transparent,
amber-coloured ova, each being about the tenth
of an inch in diameter. Though examined on the spot
with a lens, nothing could be discovered to indicate
their character. They were, however, kept in a basin,
and daily supplied with sea-water, and eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
proved to be the young of some fish. The nest varies
a great deal in size, but rarely exceeds six inches in
length, or four inches in breadth. It is pear-shaped,
and composed of sea-weed or the common coralline as
they hang suspended from the rock. They are brought
together, without being detached from their places of
growth, by a delicate opaque white thread. This thread
is highly elastic, and very much resembles silk, both
in appearance and texture: this is brought round the
plants, and tightly binds them together, plant after
plant, till the ova, which are deposited early, are completely
hidden from view. This silk-like thread is
passed in all directions through and around the mass,
in a very complicated manner. At first the thread is
semi-fluid, but by exposure it solidifies; and hence contracts
and binds the substance forming the nest so
closely together that it is able to withstand the violence
of the sea, and may be thrown carelessly about without
derangement. In the centre are deposited the ova, very
similar to the masses of frog-spawn in ditches.</p>

<p>“Some of these nests are formed in pools, and are
consequently always in water: others are frequently to
be found between tide-marks, in situations where they
hang dry for several hours in the day; but whether in
the water or liable to hang dry, they are always carefully
watched by the adult animal. On one occasion I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
repeatedly visited one every day for three weeks, and
invariably found it guarded. The old fish would examine
it on all sides, and then retire for a short time,
but soon returned to renew the examination. On several
occasions I laid the eggs bare, by removing a portion of
the nest; but when this was discovered, great exertions
were made to re-cover them. By the mouth of the fish
the edges of the opening were again drawn together, and
other portions torn from their attachments and brought
over the orifice, till the ova were again hid from view.
And as great force was sometimes necessary to effect
this, the fish would thrust its snout into the nest as far
as the eyes, and then jerk backwards till the object was
effected. While thus engaged it would suffer itself to
be taken by the hand, but repelled any attack made on
the nest, and quitted not its post so long as I remained;
and to those nests that were left dry between tide-marks,
the guardian fish always returned with the returning
tide, nor did they quit the post to any great
distance till again carried away by the receding tide.”</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the newly-hatched young
from these nests were so unlike the full-grown Stickleback,
and so like the common smooth Blenny, that Mr.
Couch concluded that there had been some error in his
observation, and that the nest truly belonged to the
latter fish. Further research, however, proved that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Stickleback was indeed the parent; and the transition
from the infantile Blenny-like outline of the face, high,
bluff, and almost perpendicular, to the true Stickleback
outline, long, slender, pointed, with the far-projecting
lower jaw, is something remarkable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRABS.</div>

<p>But now the tide has reached its lowest mark; and
as we wander over the wet sand at its very verge, our
attention is attracted by every tiny object that breaks
the uniform level, even at a considerable distance. Some
of these are worm-casts thrown up by busy Annelids,
working away in the sand to reach a lower and therefore
a wetter level, as the upper stratum dries in the
sun. But others are Crabs, of two or three species. One
of them is the somewhat uncommon and very beautiful
<i>Portumnus variegatus</i>, of which a great number are left
by the sea, but all of them dead; some of them, however,
from their freshness, only recently defunct. The
shape of the carapace, or body-shell, is very elegant, and
the colours, though sober&mdash;a light drab, mottled and
pencilled with pale lilac&mdash;are pleasing: the hindmost
pair of feet terminate in thin swimming-plates, but
they are narrow, and exhibit the natatory character in
only a subordinate degree.</p>

<p>Other Crabs are alive and active, though, to be sure,
in a somewhat sluggish way. Here we catch sight of a
slight movement in the wet sand, and, stooping, we per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>ceive
a pair of antennæ, much beset with short bristles,
projecting from the surface. They wag to and fro, and
presently up pushes a shelly head, with its pair of
stalked and jointed eyes, and two tremendously long
angular arms, furnished with awkward-looking nippers
at their extremities. Another effort, and the whole
Crab emerges from his sandy burrow, and displays his
pale buff-coloured shell, wrinkled across, and armed
with sharp spiny points at its front and edges. We
easily take him up, for his means of escape are feeble,
as he uncouthly shuffles on his short legs over the sand;
and his bellicose instincts are not strongly developed,
nor, if they were, have those long levers of arms any
formidable powers of offence. Latreille gave to the
genus the title of <i>Corystes</i>; which signifies a warrior
armed for battle, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρυς</span>, a helmet, but its inoffensiveness
belies the appellation.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Pennant had already
conferred on the species the name of <i>Cassivelaunus</i>, the
ancient British chief immortalized by Cæsar. If you
were to ask me why this obscure crab should bear a
name so renowned, I can answer only by conjecture.
The carapace is marked by wrinkles, which, while in
some specimens they suggest nothing, in others, especially
old males, bear the strongest and most ludicrous
resemblance to the face of an ancient man. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
taken specimens in which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> was so perfect
as to strike me, and others to whom I showed it,
with amazement. Now Pennant, as is well known, had
strong sympathies with his British ancestry; and perhaps,
by a not extravagant stretch of imagination, his
playful fancy saw the features of the grand old
Celtic warrior perpetuated on this Crab, which he
first met with, too, be it remembered, on the Welsh
coast.</p>

MASKED CRAB.
</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">USE OF THE ANTENNÆ.</div>

<p>Mr. Couch, in his Cornish Fauna, notices the unusual
length of the antennæ. “These organs,” he says, “are
of some use beyond their common office of feelers; perhaps,
as in some other crustaceans, they assist in the
process of excavation; and, when soiled by labour, I
have seen the Crab effect their cleaning by alternately
bending the joints of their stalks, which stand conveniently
angular for this purpose. Each of the long
antennæ is thus drawn along the brush that fringes the
internal face of the other, until both are cleared of every
particle that adhered to them.” This suggested use of
the antennæ does not seem to me to be a very felicitous
guess of the excellent Cornish naturalist: I should
fancy them to be somewhat inefficient instruments in
excavation: perhaps I can help him to a better. I
have observed that, when these Crabs are kept in
an aquarium, they are fond of sitting bolt upright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the antennæ placed close together, and also pointing
straight upward from the head. This is, doubtless, the
attitude in which the animal sits in its burrow, for the
tips of the antennæ may often be seen just projecting
from the sand. When the chosen seat has happened to
be so close to the glass side of the tank as to bring the
antennæ within the range of a pocket lens, I have
minutely investigated these organs, without disturbing
the old warrior in his meditation. I immediately saw,
on each occasion, that a strong current of water was
continuously pouring up from the points of the approximate
antennæ. Tracing this to its origin, it became
evident that it was produced by the rapid vibration
of the foot-jaws, drawing in the surrounding water,
and pouring it off upwards <i>between the united antennæ</i>,
as through a long tube. Then, on examining these
organs, I perceived that the form and arrangement of
their bristles did indeed constitute each antenna a semi-tube,
so that when the pair were brought face to face
the tube was complete. It is difficult to make this
arrangement intelligible by mere words; but I may say
that if either of the antennæ were broken off in the
middle and viewed vertically, the bristles would be seen
to project from each side of the inner face, in a curved
form, each making about a fourth of a circle, so that
the two corresponding bristles enclose, with the body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the antenna, a semicircle. Of course, those of the
opposite antenna make another semicircle, and, when
placed face to face, the points of the bristles just cross
each other, and a circle is enclosed. Now, the whole
length of the antennæ (about an inch and a half) is
closely beset with these bristles, and thus a long row of
rings is formed with very narrow interspaces between
them; and these rings do in effect constitute a tube
quite sufficient to retain the stream of water that is
poured through it.</p>

<p>I think then that we may, with an approach to certainty,
conclude that the long antennæ are intended to
keep a passage open through the sand, from the bottom
of the burrow to the superincumbent water, for the
purpose of pouring off the waste water, rendered effete
by having bathed the gills: and it is one of those exquisite
contrivances and appropriations of structure to
habit which are so constantly exciting our admiration
in the handiwork of the ever blessed God, which cannot
be predicated by the <i>à priori</i> reasoner, however astute,
but are ever rewarding the research of the patient
observer.</p>

<p>Our walk along the sands with steady downcast poring
gaze suddenly ends, and we find ourselves among
low ledges of black rock (ruddy, however, in its recent
fractures, for it is the old red sandstone), clad with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
sweltering weed, and intersected by little sparkling
pools and basins, in which the tiny fishes and entangled
prawns shoot hither and thither at our approach. It is
the low-lying ridge in the midst of the broad sandy
bight that I have already spoken of. Well, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n’importe</i>;
there is plenty of game to be obtained here, and all is
fish that comes to our net. What have we here, creeping
over the broad brown leathery leaf of this <i>Laminaria</i>?
Is it a little scrap torn from an old newspaper?
It looks like it at the first glance, only that it moves
steadily onward with a smooth gliding motion, which
shows that it possesses a life of its own. Examine it
closely: it is exactly like a bit of white paper, about as
large as a rose leaf, and cut into that shape, only with
an even edge, its clear white surface marked all over
with black parallel lines, some thinner, some thicker,
running lengthwise, and as clear as if drawn with a pen.
What answers to the base of the leaf is the head of the
creature, the pointed end being the tail, where the two
most strongly marked black lines meet; from the head
end arise two curious ear-like leaflets, which are studded
with crowded black dots, and are thrown back upon
the general surface. With a lens we may discern on
the surface of the body, just between these ear-like
tentacles, a group of black specks. These are ascertained
to be veritable eyes, notwithstanding their num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>ber,
for they have a cornea, a light-refracting body
surrounded with pigment, and a nerve-bulb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LINED EURYLEPTA.</div>

<p>As the animal glides over the surface of the smooth
weed, or over the inequalities of the rough rock, we see
that its thin papery margin is frequently thrown up into
waves, or folds, more or less distinctly revealing the inferior
surface. The movement is very even and uniform,
but the mode by which it is effected has not been satisfactorily
explained. It has been asserted that certain
staff-like bristles which project from the skin are used
as oars, but this seems doubtful. It is certain that the
whole body of the animal, as of the entire class to which
it belongs, is densely clothed with minute vibratory
cilia; and these, while they probably serve as organs
of locomotion in freely swimming, do also without doubt
make the whole skin a highly delicate and sensitive
organ of touch.</p>

<p>It is asserted of the near allies of this species, and
probably is equally true in this case, that if an individual
be cut to pieces, every portion continues to live
and feel, from whatever part of the body it may be
taken; and what is not a little remarkable, each piece,
even if it be the end of the tail, as soon as the first
moment of pain and irritation has passed, begins to
move in the same direction as that in which the entire
animal was advancing, as if the body were actuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
throughout by the same impulse; and, moreover, every
division, even if it is not more than the eighth or tenth
part of the creature, will become complete and perfect
in all its organs.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>You would naturally expect to find the creature’s
mouth at the front end, where the two tentacles are
placed, and the group of eyes, but you would search for
it there in vain. It is, in fact, situated most strangely
in the very midst of the belly; that is, at the very
centre of the inferior surface. And its structure is not
less peculiar than its locality. It consists of an orifice,
in the midst of which lies a sort of trumpet of enormous
extent when opened, but when not in active use thrown
into many folds, which, when the animal wishes to seize
prey, are thrust forth, and being partly opened, take the
appearance of many irregular tentacles radiating in all
directions, at the centre of which is the œsophagus, leading
immediately into a much ramified intestine. The
name which is given to this elegant and interesting
creature is <i>Eurylepta vittata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

BANDED FLAT-WORM. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   LONG-WORM.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>But here is another member of the same class of
strange creatures. On turning up a large flat stone, we
expose to the light of day what might readily be mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>taken
for a very long thong of black leather, or rather a
narrow strip of Indian-rubber, twisted and tied together,
and coiled in all possible contortions. If you take hold
of it, you find it not so easy to secure it as you expected,
for it is excessively lubricous and soft, and withal so extensile
and so tough, that you may pull one of the coils to
almost any length without lifting the rest of the creature.
However, you at last contrive to raise the slippery
subject, and commit it safe to your tank at home,
in which it will live an indefinite while; often invisible
for weeks at a time, lying concealed under some of the
stones, then seen perhaps in every corner of your aquarium
at once, stretching from one stone to another, and
coiling around every groin and projection, folded back
upon itself, until in the multitude of convolutions you
despair of finding head, tail, or any end at all to the
uncouth vermin. You may soon discover the signs of
its presence, however, in another way, for its voracity is
great, and it is a ferocious foe to the tube-dwelling
worms; such as the lovely <i>Sabellæ</i> and <i>Serpulæ</i>, thrusting
its serpent-like head into their tubes, and dragging
out the hapless tenant to be quickly swallowed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONG-WORM.</div>

<p>The animal is named <i>Nemertes Borlasii</i>, or sometimes
<i>Borlasia longissima</i>, in allusion to Dr. Borlase, the historian
of Cornwall. It is also occasionally termed the
Long-worm, <i>par excellence</i>, a name whose appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ness
will appear from the fact that it sometimes reaches
a length of thirty feet, with a breadth of an eighth of
an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. Kingsley has drawn the portrait of this ciliated
worm; and if he has painted it in somewhat dark colours,
and manifested more than a common measure of antipathy
to it, we must confess that the physical and moral
lineaments of the subject do in some degree justify the
description. I will quote his vivid words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS FORM AND HABITS.</div>

<p>“There are animals in which results so strange, fantastic,
even seemingly horrible, are produced, that fallen
man may be pardoned if he shrinks from them in disgust.
That, at least, must be a consequence of our own
wrong state; for everything is beautiful and perfect in
its place. It may be answered, ‘Yes, in its place; but
its place is not yours. You had no business to look at
it, and must pay the penalty for intermeddling.’ I doubt
that answer: for surely, if man have liberty to do anything,
he has liberty to search out freely his Heavenly
Father’s works; and yet every one seems to have his
antipathic animal, and I know one bred from his childhood
to zoology by land and sea, and bold in asserting,
and honest in feeling, that all without exception is beautiful,
who yet cannot, after handling, and petting, and
admiring all day long every uncouth and venomous
beast, avoid a paroxysm of horror at the sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
common house-spider. At all events, whether we were
intruding or not, in turning this stone, we must pay a
fine for having done so; for there lies an animal, as foul
and monstrous to the eye as ‘hydra, gorgon, or chimera
dire,’ and yet so wondrously fitted for its work, that we
must needs endure for our own instruction to handle
and look at it. Its name I know not (though it lurks
here under every stone), and should be glad to know.
It seems some very ‘low’ Ascarid or Planarian worm.
You see it? That black, slimy, knotted lump among
the gravel, small enough to be taken up in a dessert-spoon.
Look now, as it is raised and its coils drawn
out. Three feet! Six&mdash;nine at least, with a capability
of seemingly endless expansion; a slimy tape of living
caoutchouc, some eighth of an inch in diameter, a dark
chocolate-black, with paler longitudinal lines. Is it
alive? It hangs helpless and motionless, a mere velvet
string across the hand. Ask the neighbouring Annelids
and the fry of the rock fishes, or put it into a vase at
home, and see. It lies motionless, trailing itself among
the gravel; you cannot tell where it begins or ends; it
may be a strip of dead sea-weed, <i>Himanthalia lorea</i>,
perhaps, or <i>Chorda filum</i>; or even a tarred string. So
thinks the little fish who plays over and over it, till he
touches at last what is too surely a head. In an instant
a bell-shaped sucker mouth has fastened to its side. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
another instant, from one lip, a concave double proboscis,
just like a tapir’s (another instance of the repetition of
forms), has clasped him like a finger, and now begins
the struggle; but in vain. He is being ‘played’ with
such a fishing-rod as the skill of a Wilson or a Stoddart
never could invent; a living line, with elasticity beyond
that of the most delicate fly-rod, which follows every
lunge, shortening and lengthening, slipping and twining
round every piece of gravel and stem of sea-weed, with
a tiring drag such as no Highland wrist or step could
ever bring to bear on salmon or trout. The victim is
tired now; and slowly, yet dexterously, his blind assailent
is feeling and shifting along his side, till he reaches
one end of him; and then the black lips expand, and
slowly and surely the curved finger begins packing him
end foremost down into the gullet, where he sinks, inch
by inch, till the swelling which marks his place is lost
among the coils, and he is probably macerated into a
pulp long before he has reached the opposite extremity
of his cave of doom. Once safe down, the black murderer
contracts again into a knotted heap, and lies like
a boa with a stag inside him, motionless and blest.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<h2>VI.<br />

JUNE.</h2>


<p>We are on the narrow shingle-beach of Maidencombe,
or, sometimes, more familiarly, Minnicombe;
one of the slight indentations of this line of coast, which,
from the mouth of the Exe to Start Point, runs nearly
north and south, and so looks right up-channel, and
receives the full violence of the keen and blustering east
winds.</p>

<p>Away down the gentle slope till we come to the line
where the wavelets are kissing the rock, where the next
step would put us into King Canute’s circumstances,
where the sea is washing to and fro the shaggy weed,
and just preventing it from assuming the shrivelled and
blackened condition, into which the tufts a little above
are fast falling under the baking powers of this June
sun; and here, on these very weeds, now submerged,
now dry, are crawling some uncouth beings of a dark
liver colour or purple-brown hue. The creature passes
by the name of Sea-hare;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> a not inappropriate designa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>tion,
for I have often seen it in postures when the
resemblance to a couching hare was spontaneously
suggested. Around Weymouth, where it is common,
the fishermen and shore-boys call it the Sea-cow; which
is not a bad hit, though not so happy as that of hare.
In each case, the feature which strikes the imagination
and suggests the comparison with the quadruped, is the
pair of tentacles which stand erect, but a little diverging,
from the back of the head, and which consist of an
expanded lamina infolded at the base, and, as it were,
cut off slantingly, so as to look like a hare’s ears. There
are, indeed, two pairs of tentacles of similar structure;
but the front pair are more commonly stretched forward
horizontally, and held near the ground, so as to be much
less conspicuous.</p>

SEA-HARE.
</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-HARE.</div>

<p>The animal is one of the Sea-slugs, allied, not remotely,
to the <i>Doris</i> and the lovely <i>Eolis</i>, which occupied
our attention some time ago. The order to which
it belongs is, however, distinguished from them by
having the breathing organs covered. In our Sea-hare
these take the form of complicated leaflets, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
placed upon the middle of the back, and are protected
by a broad plate of shell, somewhat like a watch-glass
of irregular outline, very thin and transparent, and very
brittle when dry. During life, this shelly plate is imbedded
in the substance of the skin of the back, a thin
layer of which clothes it; so thin that it can be very
readily seen and felt notwithstanding. The mantle is
much developed, forming two great irregular wing-like
lobes, which stand up on each side of the body, and at
pleasure either arch over the gill-shield, or are depressed,
and widely expose it. It is reported that these
mantle-lobes are capable of being used as swimming-fins,
by their undulations; but I doubt the correctness
of the observation.</p>

<p>When full-grown, our Sea-hare is three inches in
length, and upwards of an inch high. Its body is of a
slimy, fleshy, slug-like texture, varying much in colour;
sometimes being dark olive-green, sometimes red-brown,
sometimes deep purple, occasionally clouded with blue:
sometimes the hue is uniform; at others, it is varied
by light dots, or handsomely marked with dark rings
enclosing white areas. Its figure is extremely versatile;
so that, when crawling, it scarcely exhibits the
same outline for two minutes together.</p>

<p>See what has happened. On dropping one of the
slimy beasts into this phial of clear sea-water, it imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>diately
resented the incarceration by beginning to pour
out from beneath the lobes of the mantle a thin stream
of fluid of the most royal purple hue, which freely
diffused itself through the water. And see! it is still
copiously exuding; and the whole contents of the bottle
are now fast becoming of so fine and rich a tinge, as
already to veil the form of the animal. Attempts have
been made to employ this secretion in the arts; but
the hue is fleeting. According to Cuvier, it assumes
in drying the beautiful deep hue of the flower known
as the sweet scabious, and remains long unaltered by
exposure to the air. The purple tint is readily transferred
to spirit, when the animal is immersed in it;
the tincture retains the colour for a while, but ultimately
becomes of a deep clear port-wine tint. Linen, dyed
with the fluid, soon fades to a dingy brown.</p>

<p>It is a curious coincidence that this mollusk possesses
a more recondite analogy with herbivorous mammalia,
than a fleeting resemblance of form. Professor Grant
has shown that it has three stomachs, like the ruminants.
First, a short narrow gullet dilates into a large
membranous crop; a curved bag, which is generally
filled with pieces of coarse sea-weed. This large crop
or paunch occupies the right side of the body, and opens
laterally into the middle stomach, which is the smallest
of all, and performs the part of the gizzard. Its coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
are thickened; and the interior callous lining is besat
with firm horny processes, in the form of rhomboidal
plates or molar teeth, which serve to compress the
softened vegetable matter transmitted in small portions
from the first stomach. The third cavity of this complex
apparatus is placed on the left side of the body;
its interior surface is studded with sharp, horny spines,
resembling canine teeth, to pierce and subdivide the
coarse food, and thus prepare it for the action of the
gastric juice and other fluids accessory to digestion,
which enter the stomach from adjacent organs.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The complexity of this structure has reference to the
coarseness of the materials on which the animal subsists;
the leathery fronds of the olive sea-weeds, which slowly
and with difficulty yield their nutritive elements to the
digestive functions.</p>

<p>This great, flabby Sea-Slug has a mythic history full
of wild romance. Our species has been often called
<i>depilans</i>, because the fluid which exudes from it was
said to have the power of causing the hair to fall from
the human head which it touched; and the common
species of Southern Europe retains the appellation in
the records of science. The Mediterranean fishermen
have so great a horror of it that no bribes will induce
them to handle it willingly; and they tell strange stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of wounds being produced, limbs being mortified, and
even death itself being caused, by accidental or foolhardy
contact with the potent creature.</p>

<p>Bohadsch has given, on the authority of personal
observation, a minutely circumstantial account, which
it seems a hyper-scepticism to doubt. When removed
from the sea, and placed in a vessel, there exuded a
large quantity of a limpid and somewhat mucilaginous
fluid, exhaling a sweetish, sickening, peculiar smell:
but besides this, and distinct from its purple secretion,
the <i>Aplysia</i> excreted also a milky liquor, formed in an
internal conglobate gland, which seems to be analogous
to the kidney of vertebrate animals. As often as
he took the <i>Aplysia</i> from the vase of sea-water and
placed it on a plate with the view of more narrowly
examining its structure, the room was filled with a
nauseous odour, compelling his wife and brother to
leave the room, lest sickness and vomiting should
follow. He himself could scarcely endure it, and during
the examination had repeatedly to go out and
breathe a purer air. His hands and cheeks swelled
after handling the creature for any length of time, and
as often as it ejaculated its milky secretion; but he
is uncertain whether the swelling of the face proceeded
from the halitus merely, or from his having accidentally
touched it with the hand besmeared with the liquid:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
probably the latter was the real cause, for when he
purposely applied some of it to his chin, some hairs
fell from the part.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>We may add to this account, as being in a measure
confirmatory of its probability, the statement of a perfectly
dependable naturalist, Mr. Charles Darwin, that he
found a species of <i>Aplysia</i> at St. Jago, one of the Cape
Verd Isles, from which “an acrid secretion, which is
spread over its body, causes a sharp stinging sensation,
similar to that produced by the Physalia,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> or Portuguese
man-of-war.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> And yet I have myself freely handled
<i>Aplysiæ</i> in health and vigour, both here and on the
coast of Jamaica, without perceiving the slightest unpleasant
sensation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS BAD CHARACTER.</div>

<p>But in the days of ancient Rome the poor Sea-hare
had a far more terrific reputation. In those dark days
of the Empire when no one’s life was secure against
insidious assassination, and when professed poisoners
were at the command of such as could afford to pay
their hire, this mollusk was an essential element of the
fatal draught. “Locusta used it to destroy such as were
inimical to Nero; it entered into the potion which
she prepared for the tyrant himself; and Domitian was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
accused of having given it to his brother Titus. To
search after the Sea-hare was to render one’s-self suspected;
and when Apuleius was accused of magic,
because, forsooth, he had induced a rich widow to marry
him, the principal proof against him was that he had
hired the fishermen to procure him this fearful animal.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
He succeeded, however, in showing, to the satisfaction
of his judges, that his object was merely the gratification
of laudable scientific curiosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TUSK-SHELL.</div>

<p>Peering into the deep and narrow fissures with which
the rocky ledge is cleft, we observe some shells which
properly belong to the deep sea bottom, but have been
doubtless washed into the shallow, by some heavy
ground-swell, and left where we now see them. Here
are several fragments, and one or two nearly perfect
specimens, of what looks like an elephant’s tusk in
miniature, but is really the shell of a small Gastropod
mollusk commonly known as the Tusk-shell.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In
colour, form, and curvature, the resemblance is complete,
but the length of a perfect shell rarely exceeds an inch
and a half, with a diameter of one-eighth of an inch
at the larger end. The animal is remarkable for having
long been a subject of dispute with learned zoologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
as to its true affinities; by some being considered as a
true mollusk allied to the Limpets, by others as a worm
allied to the <i>Serpulæ</i>. Anatomy determines it to be
rightly located by the former opinion, and yet the
possession of red blood, and some other peculiarities
belonging to the <i>Annelida</i>, indicate a curious relationship
with this class, so that we may consider it as one
of those interesting forms which link together two
great divisions of the animal kingdom.</p>

LIGIA. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TORBAY BONNET. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TUSK-SHELL.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>When the Tusk-shell is found alive, we rarely can
see more of the soft parts than a sort of white cushion
occupying the mouth of the shell, and occasionally
protruding or receding, with a little conical point
projecting from the centre of it. You might keep it
for weeks, as I have done, and see no more, by the
most assiduous watching, than this; but at some fortunate
moment you might perchance see the whole foot,
of which this little cone is the extremity, thrust far out
of the cushion-like collar, when you would discern a
wide lobed membrane, fringing the base of the foot,
trumpet-like in shape, or resembling the blossom of
a convolvulus, with the thick and pointed foot projecting
from its centre like a pistil.</p>

<p>These sluggish white mollusks ordinarily live on
the muddy sea-floor, or burrow in it, where they devour
minuter animals, such as <i>Foraminifera</i>, and the spawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
and larval forms of their fellow <i>Mollusca</i>. They are
rarely taken alive at a less depth than ten fathoms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TORBAY BONNET.</div>

<p>But we have also an example of a much rarer shell,
the Torbay Bonnet, or Cap of Liberty.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The shape,
which is exactly that of the ancient Phrygian bonnet,
or the modern emblem of liberty, is sufficiently commemorated
in all the appellations by which it is known,
both scientific and popular. This specimen is but an empty
shell, but the freshness of the colours, and the beautiful
polish of the interior show that the animal cannot have
been long dead, for the porcellaneous smoothness and
gloss of shells very soon become defaced after their
exposure by the death and decay of the soft parts. The
interior of this shell is of a most lovely rose-pink, very
glossy, and the exterior is nearly of the same hue,
though this is concealed by a horny skin which closely
invests it, and is covered with a shaggy pile that projects
even beyond the edge, in the form of a ragged
yellow fringe. This rough epidermis is of a hue varying
from a bright yellow-olive to a dull wood-brown;
it is frequently rubbed off in the upper parts, when
the natural hue of the shell is there seen.</p>

<p>This species is rare enough, and large enough, and
handsome enough to be a prize worth finding, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
picked up in so fresh a condition as this; but, of course,
it is more valuable when it occurs in a living state.
But this scarcely ever happens except by dredging, or
by trawling. I have frequently had it brought to me
by trawlers both at Weymouth and Tenby, oftenest by
the former, who get it in deep water, from thirty to
fifty fathoms, on the western side of Portland.</p>

<p>The living animal is not unworthy of its elegantly
painted house. Its colour is usually pale yellow, with
a rose-pink mantle, bordered by a fine orange-coloured
fringe. The head is large and swollen, furnished with
tentacles, which carry the eyes at their bases. The
tongue-ribbon carries seven rows of teeth, of which the
central one differs in shape from the rest.</p>

<p>I have kept a specimen in the aquarium for a considerable
time, with very little addition to my knowledge
as the result. It remained adhering to the scallop
shell on which it was found almost all the time I had
it, occasionally shifting a hair’s-breadth to the one side
or the other. Almost always the fringed edge of the
shell was so closely applied to the support as absolutely
to forbid intrusion; but now and then a very
slight lifting of the edge all round gave me the narrowest
possible peep at the broad cream-coloured foot adhering
to its rest. Thus it went on tantalizing me, till
after some months I lost it, I forget how.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>A close ally of this form is a pretty shell which we
often obtain by dredging, called the Cup-and-Saucer
Limpet. It is a pretty little white porcellaneous cone,
with a curved plate of thin shell projecting from the
side of the interior, like a semi-cup within the cup. It
is named <i>Calyptræa</i>. Both this and the Torbay Bonnet
have been ascertained to manifest domestic instincts,
in sitting on their eggs till they are hatched. According
to MM. Audouin and Milne Edwards, the parent
<i>Calyptræa</i> “disposes them under her belly, and preserves
them, as it were imprisoned, between the foot
and the foreign body to which she adheres, her patelloid
shell thus serving not only to cover and protect herself,
but as a shield to her offspring. These eggs are oval
bodies of a yellow colour, enclosed in membranous capsules,
which are elliptical, flattened, translucid, and
filled with an albuminous matter. The number of these
little capsules varies from six to ten; they are connected
among themselves by a footstalk, so as to represent a
sort of rosette; each of them contains from eight to ten
eggs. It appears that the young <i>Calyptræa</i> are developed
under this sort of maternal roof, and do not
quit it until they are in a condition to affix themselves,
and are provided with a shell sufficiently hard to protect
their own bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOCUST SCREW.</div>

<p>Along the margins of these shallow rock-pools with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sandy bottoms, we see many little grey shrimp-like
creatures, with thick-set arching bodies, which swim
rapidly, and with much vibration of the abdominal feet,
from weed to weed. If we catch one and lay it on the
rock or on the wet sand, it appears very helpless, for
its vertically thin shape and arched attitude preclude
the possibility of its crawling: it falls upon its side,
and vainly struggles round and round as on a pivot, or
makes aimless jerks by throwing out the tail. It is of
a greenish blue, or glaucous colour, marked with red
dots. This is the common Locust Screw,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which is so
confined to sea-water, that it has been affirmed that if
put into fresh water it presently dies. But the experiments
of Mr. Robertson negative this statement:<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> he
has found that five out of seven, after being eighteen
hours in rain-water, continued to live upon being returned
to salt water.</p>

<p>I delight to trace the manifestations of parental love
in these tiny forms of animal life. It had long been
known that the females of this species display a solicitude
for their infant offspring, which they carry for
some time about with them; but the following very
pleasing details of maternal manners have recently been
observed by my relative, Dr. James Salter, and by him
communicated to the learned zoologists who are now
engaged upon the history of this <span class="lock">order:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>“On catching a female with live larvæ, nothing is
seen of the progeny till the parent has become at home
in the aquarium, when the little creatures leave her,
and swim about in her immediate neighbourhood. The
plan I have adopted to watch this curious habit of
maternal protection has been to place a single individual
in a bottle of sea-water. After a time, and that
soon, the little crustacean seems at ease, and swims
slowly about, when the young fry leave, and swarm
around her in a perfect cloud; they never leave for
more than half or three-quarters of an inch, and as she
slowly moves about they accompany her. If, now, one
taps the sides of the bottle with one’s finger-nail, the
swarm of larvæ rush under their parent, and in a second
are out of sight. The parent now becomes excited, and
swims about quickly, as if trying to escape; but on
letting the bottle containing her rest quite still on a
table, she soon gets composed, when out come the young
larvæ again, and swim about as before. This may be
repeated as often as the observer wishes, and always
with the same result. I have only seen this in one
species, but it is quite a common species in Poole Harbour,
and I have watched the interesting habit many
times.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FRESH-WATER SCREW.</div>

<p>Every little stream and ditch of running water in our
lanes and fields abounds with a species, which, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
for the fresh-water habit, and a little difference in the
shade of colour,&mdash;the latter being of a yellowish, instead
of a bluish grey,&mdash;is so absolutely identical with the
Locust Screw, that, notwithstanding it is registered
under a name of its own, <i>Gammarus pulex</i>, it is difficult
to believe that the two are not of common parentage.
Certain facts observed in Sweden give colour to
such a suspicion. The large inland seas of fresh water,
Lakes Wetter and Wener, in the south of that country,
are situated on high ground, and have the surface of
their water 300 feet above the level of the Baltic,
whereas the bottom is 120 feet below such level. In
these lakes (which appear to have been lifted up with
the gradual uprising of the country) have been found
several genera and species of Crustacea, three of which
are <span class="smcap lowercase">AMPHIPODA</span>, which are affirmed to be identical with
marine ones, viz., <i>Gammaracanthus loricatus</i> (Sabine,
Ross, Kröyer), <i>Pontoporeia affinis</i> (Lindström), and
<i>Gammarus cancelloides</i> (Gerstfeldt).</p>

<p>The first is now only known to exist in the Arctic
seas, the second in the Baltic, and the last was found in
Lake Baikal, in Central Asia. It is therefore suggested
by Lovèn, that the land was raised so as to convert
these waters from marine bays into inland lakes. These
marine species were retained within the basins, the
waters of which have since been changed, through the
agency of springs, into fresh water; and with the gra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>dual
transfer of the water, the habits of the animals
have also changed gradually, and that without any outward
alteration of form. Professor Lovèn thinks that
there is sufficient evidence to show that this change in
the condition of these lakes must have taken place
during the great glacier period, at a time when the
animals now found in it (and which are known at this
day only to inhabit the extreme north) could have lived
in the same latitude as the south of Sweden. The evidence
of these fresh-water lakes suggests that similar
changes in the relative position of sea and land may
have been the cause of our having fresh-water Crustacea
nearly allied to marine species in our rivers and
inland streams.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Crawling about perpendicular faces of rocks, generally
at a considerable distance above high-water mark, we
may find a crustacean, not very remotely allied to these,
of rather large size.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> It is broad and flat, a form which
marks it as belonging to another order, though in many
peculiarities of structure agreeing with its near neighbours
the high-backed Screws. The present species
crawls readily with its fourteen short strongly-hooked
feet, with which it clings to every little roughness of the
stone. It swims much less effectively: indeed, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
never seen it spontaneously in the water; and those
which I have captured on the rocks, and transferred to
an aquarium, have died after a very brief interval. They
have little agility under any circumstances, and trust
rather to craft than to power for their safety. When
alarmed, they instantly gather in their feet, and drop
from their hold; and, as I have said that the positions
in which they are found are for the most part perpendicular
surfaces, such as cliffs and sea-walls, their one
trick is often successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA WOODLOUSE.</div>

<p>Thus the <i>Ligia</i> makes a decided approach to an aërial
or terrestrial mode of life; which, indeed, is strictly the
habit of some species with which every cultivator of
flowers is only too familiar. I refer to the little Woodlice,
or Buttons, or Sows, as they are variously called,
so abundant in gardens, especially in pits and frames,
and so annoying for their depredations on our cherished
plants. These garden pests are scarcely to be distinguished
as to their structure from the semi-marine
<i>Ligia</i>, particularly those flatter and softer species (<i>Porcellio</i>),
which do not roll their body into a complete ball.</p>

<p>In all these creatures we find maternal care. The
females carry their eggs in a sort of pouch or sac, placed
beneath the breast, which opens when these are hatched
to afford exit for the infant progeny. These have from
the first the same form and appearance as the adult,
except that they have at first six pairs of feet instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of seven. They cling about the body of the mother,
and are carried by her in her rovings with affecting
solicitude.</p>

<p>About the sloping ledges of low-lying rock, especially
those which are covered with young mussels, so closely
that between their blue-black shells, packed and tied
together with byssus-threads, you can scarcely thrust a
penknife, we very commonly see slender Worms of a
vivid grass-green hue gliding in and out. Their movements
are very graceful, and if we examine them closely,
we discern the presence of a multitude of minute points
along each side of the body, which in turn are thrust
out and as quickly retracted. If we put the little creature
into a vase of water, we see fresh powers and organs
of locomotion; for the back bears a double series of
leaf-shaped fins, overlying one another, which act as
broadoars rowing the lithe and graceful worm through
the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAINBOW LEAF-WORM.</div>

<p>This species<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> is not more than three inches in length;
but there is another<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> much less common, which is larger,
richer in colours, and altogether a finer species. A specimen

when crawling, and nearly a quarter of an inch in width.
The whole body was divided into distinct segments,
which in this individual were about two hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
ten in number; though, according to MM. Audouin and
Milne Edwards,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> they sometimes amount to nearly five
hundred, and the worm has been found two feet in
length. The head is small, terminated by two pairs of
very minute antennæ, but surrounded at what we may
call the neck by four pairs of rather long feelers (tentacular
cirri), with a fifth pair which are minute and
rudimentary.</p>

PEARLY NEREIS. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  RAINBOW LEAF-WORM.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The colours are very beautiful. The leaf-like fins of
the sides, which are somewhat heart-shaped, are of a
yellowish green hue, occasionally clouded with blackish;
the middle portion of the back, which is exposed,
is of a rich brown, but flushed with the most glowing
iridescence of blue and purple; while the whole under
parts are of a pearly flesh-colour. As it crawls over
the stones, it throws its body into the most elegant
lateral curves, while its suppleness and great length
cause it to cling close to the rock; and thus its outline
takes the form of every projection and depression over
which it is wandering.</p>

<p>When disturbed, and often without any apparent provocation,
we see the under side of the tiny head rise
from the ground, swell out, and turn itself inside out, as
you turn a stocking, until a great pear-shaped bag is protruded,
fully eight times as long, and thrice as broad as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the entire head. Its whole surface is rough and papillose,
and around its extremity, which is the largest part, there
is a row of small knobs or warts. This curious organ is
found under similar conditions in very many Annelids;
it is commonly called the proboscis, or evertile œsophagus;
but in truth it is a special and peculiar apparatus,
with little analogy with anything found in higher
animals: it is in some species furnished with strong
horny teeth, and is doubtless employed for the capture
of living prey, and the conveyance of it to the stomach.</p>

<p>The tail of the specimen I refer to was evidently being
renewed after having been accidentally lost. For the
body-segments ended abruptly, and were followed by a
portion, not more than an eighth of an inch long, white,
and excessively delicate; but which, when examined
with a powerful magnifier, displayed a division into
segments, each segment carrying its proper cirri; I
could count twenty segments within that minute space,
the last of which carried the usual pair of stylets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REPRODUCTION OF ORGANS.</div>

<p>I find among my notes a record of a specimen of
<i>Phyllodoce</i>, which, if not identical with this, was closely
allied to it, in which I observed the continuance of
vitality after the severance of the creature into parts.
It was sent to me from Torquay, when I lived near
London. When it arrived I found that about an inch
and a quarter of the anterior extremity was detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from the remainder, which measured about four inches.
The former was motionless, contracted, and seemed lifeless;
the latter moved freely. I put both into an old
aquarium. The long posterior portion glided about
among the stones for two days, exactly like a living
healthy animal; the anterior part remained motionless
and contracted until the third day, when I saw it
also gliding over the stones in a most lively manner,
rearing its head, and feeling about in the manner of a
caterpillar. Eight days after its arrival, the head portion
was still active and apparently healthy, but the hinder
part had become motionless and was evidently dead. I
find no further record of the case, and probably the
anterior part ultimately died without reproduction; but
the length of the period of its survival in apparent
vigour, renders it not improbable that in the open sea,
under the influence of abundant oxygen, and suitable
food, the wanting parts might have been renewed to the
fore-part, if not to both.</p>

<p>To return to my more recent captive, however. I
killed it for cabinet preservation by putting it into
fresh water, where it presently died, with the noticeable
circumstance that it threw out mucus in such profusion
that the whole body was enveloped in a mass,
much thicker than itself, of clear jelly, excessively tough
and tenacious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The most common members of the class <i>Annelida</i>,
that we meet with in these situations, are different
species of the genus <i>Nereis</i>, which are for the most
part worms of considerable size, usually brown or
green, with a changeable metallic lustre above, and
brilliantly pearly beneath. They have a distinct head,
of a squarish form, terminating in two swollen fleshy
knob-like antennæ, and furnished with four pairs of
thread-like tentacular cirri, which project on each side
like a cat’s whiskers. The body is plump, though somewhat
flattened, and bears on each side a row of fleshy foot-warts,
which are pierced for the extrusion of the curious
bristles that are so characteristic of these marine worms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEARLY NEREIS.</div>

<p>We can scarcely turn one of these flat stones which
lie half-buried in sandy mud at the water’s edge without
finding one or more of this tribe. Let us try. Here
at once is a specimen, one of the finest as well as one of
the commonest of all.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The upper surface is of a warm
fawn-brown; but the beautiful flashes of iridescent
blue that play on it in the changing light, and the
exquisite pearly opalescence of the delicate pink beneath,
are so conspicuous as to have secured it the title of
“Pearly,” <i>par éminence</i>. As you gaze upon it you see
the great dorsal blood-vessel or heart, as a dark red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
line running along the middle of the back. This, at
irregular intervals of five to fifteen seconds, contracts
almost to invisibility, and then expands again, taking
the form of a string of beads in each process.</p>

<p>This, however, is only a part of the great circulating
system in this fine worm. In it the red blood flows
from the tail towards the head; at the under side of
the body, there is a similar vessel (the ventral), through
which the blood flows from the head towards the tail.
Besides these, there are four other longitudinal vessels
in the interior of the body, one above and one below the
intestine, and one on each side, all of which are connected
by transverse branches. Thus there is a double
circulation. “The great dorsal,” says Dr. Williams,
“the reservoir of the centripetal streams of the body,
may be likened to a right ventricle (the lungs cut off),
and the great ventral to a left ventricle. The duty of
the former is to collect the refluent blood of the system;
of the latter to circulate it again.”</p>

<p>Our <i>Nereis</i> is furnished with two pairs of dark blue
eyes, and with an evertile proboscis, which consists of
two segments. The one first protruded is beset on its
upper side with some largish horny points, arranged in
two groups, which are continued round to the under
side in a band of irregular lines of points. The
second segment has four groups of points, the groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of oblong outline, radiating from the strong black jaws,
which are protruded last, and can be widely opened
and closed.</p>

<p>Here, too, we have an Annelid of very different form
and appearance.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It is a mean-looking worm, about an
inch and a half long, of flattened shape, blunt at each
end, apparently covered with a smooth skin of a dull
brown colour; but on being touched it presently throws
itself into elegant serpentine curves, and then what
appears to be the upper skin is seen to be composed
of a great number of round flat membranous plates or
shields, arranged in two rows overlapping each other.
These, though of large size, are attached to the body
only by a small point in the centre of their under side,
so that when the animal moves, the edges of these
shields are lifted, and reveal their true structure, sliding
upon one another in a singular manner.</p>

<p>In captivity I have found the animal inert, prone to
seek concealment in the corners of the glass vessel
beneath other animals or stones, and remaining still
for a long time together; but, if disturbed, manifesting
impatience and much agility, swimming through the
water with strong lateral undulation, as already described.
I have been struck with the deciduous character
of the broad leaf-like shields. As soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
animal was in my possession, one and another of these
appendages was cast off at almost every time that I
roused it to action; and even when allowed to remain
quiet, the denuding process went on, so that in a few
days it was nearly half naked. This process of self-mutilation
will sometimes go on till scarcely a single
shield remains out of the double series.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCALE-WORM.</div>

<p>This dull-coloured Scale-worm presents peculiarities
of structure which are eminently worthy of careful
examination. The body, like that of the other species
we have just been considering, is composed of many
rings or segments, each of which bears on its upper
surface a little wart or tubercle on each side, to the
summit of which is slightly attached the circular leaf-like
shield just described. Beneath the shadow of this
broad shield the segment projects laterally into another
tubercle, whence issue the organs of motion, which in
these Annelids are of highly curious structure. In
this species they consist of a bundle of straight bristles
of exquisite tenuity, and having a silky lustre; they
are of unequal length, the upper ones being the longest,
and the pencil diminishing pretty regularly downwards.
The microscope shows them to be about one hundred
in number in each bundle; and each bristle to be a
delicate oar consisting of a slender stem, apparently
tubular, dilated at the tip into a narrow blade terminat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ing
in a minute hook. A fibrous structure is seen to
run diagonally across the blade, the edge of which is
set with minute barbs pointing outwards, resembling
very fine and very short bristles. The whole bundle
is connected with a long slender rod of cartilage, which,
doubtless acted upon by proper muscles, moves to and
fro through the muscular sheath, protruding the bundle
of bristles, or entirely retracting them within the body.
The bristles, when protruded, slightly diverge, so that
the dilated blades of these hundred oars strike with full
force upon the water in rowing, if such indeed is the
nature of their action, as some have supposed. In the
act of withdrawal, however, into the narrow compass
of the muscular sheath, the blades slide one upon
another, so as to present a surface considerably diminished.
But why is each bristle hooked and barbed?
The obvious supposition is that these organs act like
the pole of a ferry-boat in the shallows; the barbs,
pointing outwards, serving to catch any roughness of
the surface, and thus to <i>push</i> the animal by their
resistance, while the terminal hook may serve to <i>pull</i>
in an analogous manner. But then the barbed and
hooked edge is the <i>upper</i> one of each oar, a circumstance
which renders such an explanation at first sight
unsatisfactory. Perhaps, however, the habit of the
animal of living under stones, may in some measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
account for it; the edge and point of each bristle being
intended to act upon the surface of the object above it,
beneath which it is forcing its way.</p>

<p>A secondary pencil of bristles also issues from the
upper side of each of these tubercular sheaths, so as to
project diagonally upwards and outwards beneath the
edge of the shield-leaf. This pencil consists of between
thirty and forty bristles, which are connected with a
cartilaginous rod exactly similar to that of the primary
bundle. These bristles run off to a very fine point, and
each one is marked on both sides with serratures so
delicate as to be only just discernible with a magnifying
power of 300 diameters. There are thus about 270
movable bristles of exquisite structure in each segment,
which multiplied by 36, the number of segments in the
body, gives a total of 9720 distinct organs of motion
possessed by this animal, besides the broad leaf-like
shields, which perhaps may act as fins, and the short
tentacular feet, one of which is placed beneath the primary
bristle-sheath, on each side of the segment.</p>

<p>By dissection after death, I have found the proboscis
in the form of a long oval sac, very muscular and firm,
of a blackish hue, lying in the anterior part of the body,
which, on being cut open, showed four horny teeth
placed in its neck so as to meet each other in the
centre. I have never seen the protrusion of this organ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
during life, but if it is capable of being wholly everted,
as in many species, these teeth must be turned on the
outside, where they would seem to be of little use.
Possibly, however, the version may be only just sufficient
to bring these teeth to the margin, when their
action might be made very efficient by the slightest
alteration in the contraction of the sac.</p>

<p>Some species of this genus construct for themselves
enveloping tubular cases, out of mucus given off from
their bodies, and fragments of shells. In these they
ordinarily live concealed, but are sufficiently active
when they leave their houses. Some shine with a
phosphorescent radiance in the dark.</p>

<p>In the great class of Worms, special organs for locomotion
are often altogether lacking; and, where found,
are only rudimentary. Alternate swellings and contractions
of certain portions of the body are a great
source of progression; and these are effected by the
fluids of the interior, which are driven to a given part
of the cavity, and momentarily imprisoned there by the
contraction of the circular tegumentary muscles before
and behind it; the body swelling at that place. “The
muscles of the integument are then excited to action,
and the fluid is forcibly compressed forwards or backwards,
according to the direction of the muscular agency.
Nearly all Annelids are struck with paralysis when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
fluid is made to escape from its cavity by a puncture
through its external walls. The power of voluntary
motion is suspended; the body of the worm becomes
passive and flaccid.”<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">GOODNESS OF GOD.</div>

<p>These details convey but a feeble and imperfect notion
of the numerous and elaborate contrivances which are
so profusely bestowed upon these mean and grovelling
worms; but they show how careful is the Creator of
their well-being; how lavish of His mercies towards His
meanest creatures. How unreasonable, then, is it for
those to doubt His ever-watchful and unerring tenderness
towards themselves, who have been made the
objects of His <i>redeeming</i> love, and who, on the ground
of redemption, “are of more value” in His sight, than
all these His lower creatures put together!</p>

<h2>VII.<br />

JULY.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">TWO-SPOTTED SUCKER.</div>

<p>A mile or two eastward of Babbicombe and Petit Tor,
in from ten to fifteen fathoms water, there lies a stretch
of flat stony bottom, reaching away from the island
known as the Ore Stone, towards the mouth of the river
Exe. This is a bit of ground to which a boatman
whom I occasionally employ often resorts with the
dredge, and rarely or never without a fair harvest of
curious and interesting creatures. Among other things
he brings me from time to time numerous specimens of
what Yarrell calls the Bimaculated Sucker;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the propriety
of which name will be evident the moment you
examine one of these little fishes alive. Cuvier named
the group in which they are found (a group comprising
very few species) <i>Discoboles</i>, because the ventral pair of
fins are united so as to form a circular disk or saucer,
by means of which the fishes have the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
adhering firmly to any solid object larger than the
circumference of the disk. Yarrell substitutes the term
<i>Cyclopteridæ</i> for the family group; the name <i>Cyclopterus</i>,
used for the principal genus, expressing the same thing,
that the fins are united in a circular fashion. The word
<i>bimaculatus</i>, signifying two-spotted, alludes to two
remarkable and conspicuous oval spots of dark purplish
brown or red, situated one on each side of the body,
just behind the pectoral fin. These spots, being comparatively
large, and separated from the general colour
of the body by a well-defined white ring, constitute a
very striking and beautiful feature in these little fishes.</p>

TWO-SPOTTED SUCKER.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Their form is flattened; they have a broad shovel-shaped
muzzle, prominent eyes, looking rather upwards,
and the head much widened behind; the head, indeed,
constitutes more than one-fourth of the entire length;
and at its hinder part, or where the gills open, is far
wider than any other part of the fish. They rarely
exceed an inch and a half in length. The general hue
above is pale red; but in some specimens they become
a nearly uniform lake-purple, in others the hue is a
clear orange; while yet in others it is almost white.
A band of white, bounded by darker lines, almost invariably
connects the two eyes. Frequently the hue
of the body is varied by clouds and patches of dark
reddish brown, which patches have a tendency to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
assume a constant pattern, quite recognisable when you
look at a good many specimens together. In the hinder
half and on the sides the ground colour is apt to be
minutely divided or mottled, the interspaces being of
a delicate azure or lilac; and when examined with a
lens, the whole surface seems sown with gold dust.
The dorsal fin is set very far back, and, as well as the
caudal, is prettily pencilled with dark brown: the
under parts are pearly white.</p>

<p>The eyes are exquisitely beautiful, and as they are
prominent, very movable, and especially as they are
moved quite independently of each other, they at once
attract and fix the admiration of the beholder. The
large pupil is of a deep lustrous green, the iris of the
most brilliant orange gold, and the whole set as it were
in the midst of a globe of the purest glass. On the whole
I scarcely know of a more attractive little fish than this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS HABITS.</div>

<p>This little Sucker is easily reconciled to captivity.
I have in my aquariums some individuals which were
captured nearly a year and a half ago; and they are
still in the full enjoyment of health and activity. They
are pleasing little things: they scuttle from spot to
spot with a spasmodic sort of bustle, wagging their tails
much from time to time, so that in movement as well
as in form they remind one of tadpoles. They are
generally seen, however, anchored to the sides of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
vessel, or to the prominent knobs of the stones by their
sucker, and here they remain for an indefinite time,
sometimes for hours, at others only a few seconds,
throwing their beautiful eyes about in insatiable curiosity,
fanning the water with their transparent pectorals,
or whisking the painted tail about. Now and then
they make a sudden snap, doubtless at some passing
animalcule, with an audible sound, and the emergence
of a bubble of air from the top of the water, whence the
muzzle is frequently projected. They have an awkward
habit of throwing themselves out of a shallow vessel;
and if you are not on your guard you may find your
little pets dead and dry on the carpet. They are
inquisitive little things; if a new stone or shell or
tuft of serpulæ is put into their vessel they soon discover
it, and may be seen exploring it in every part;
and it is amusing, when <i>you</i> are examining <i>them</i> with a
lens, to note how thoroughly mutual is the investigation;
for you can see by the direction and motion of the eyes
that the little fish is watching you as interestedly as
you are observing him.</p>

<p>I do not think that the adhesion of the ventral sucker
is effected exactly as has been supposed, by a vacuum
produced in the area of the united ventral fins; but by
the combined action of some minute fleshy sucking
disks, which are arranged in two groups, in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and behind the united fins. The conjoined fins do not
appear to me to make a vacuum. The fish has a curious
habit of coming to the surface of the water, and there
floating perfectly still, back downward, the entire belly-surface
dry. The ventral disk is then seen as a shallow
cup, quite dry and shining. If touched, the little fish
hurries along the surface, with some splashing, till it
acquires impetus enough to go under at an oblique
angle, when it presently turns over, and adheres to the
bottom, or side of some stone. I have seen this practice
frequently, but only, I think, at night.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This principle of a vacuum produced by the retraction
of the centre of a fleshy disk, while the margins remain
in close contact with a solid body, is of extensive application
in the lower forms of animal life, and especially in
the class <span class="smcap">Echinodermata</span>, comprising what are popularly
known as Star-fishes, Sea-urchins, and Sea-cucumbers.</p>

<p>I have on other occasions noticed the elaborate and
wonderful mechanism of the sucker-feet as they appear
in the commoner species of the class. I need not therefore
repeat those details, but look at a few other particulars
in the economy of the animals whose locomotion
is dependent on this curious contrivance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a pretty little species abundant enough
hereabout, chiefly affecting shores on which numerous
angular masses of stone lie irregularly scattered and
heaped one on another. Yet they seem to have a predilection,
for they do not occur in all our localities even
though these conditions be not lacking. Livermead Point,
and the south side of Anstey’s Cove, beneath the cliffs,
are favourite spots for them, the former especially, where
we can find the little Gibbous Starlet,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> for such is its
name, at all times of the year, when the tide is sufficiently
out. The retiring tide here leaves a shallow
pool of considerable area, which then continues to run
out by a narrow channel among the rock boulders, a
winding rivulet of salt water; along whose borders, by
turning over the loose blocks, scores of this pretty Star
are exposed, clinging to the wet sides and roofs of the
dark passages by means of their sucker-feet. Forbes
has given two figures of the species, but manifestly
taken from dead specimens, and from very small ones
too. He says, “large specimens measure only an inch
across;” from which I infer that on the shores of the
Isle of Man, where he was familiar with it, the Starlet
does not attain the dimensions it reaches on our mild
southern coast. He indeed alludes to one in Mr. Ball’s
collection, which measured one inch and five lines in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
diameter. Specimens, however, of this size are quite
common with us, nor would one of an inch and a half
be looked upon as at all exceeding the modest and proper
range of the species.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ITS EYES.</div>

<p>It is of a pentagonal figure, with the margin a little
receding between the angles, but not so as to cause the
latter to form distinct arms. The body is flat below,
and plump and cushion-like above, of a yellowish olive
hue, with the very edge of a golden orange tint, while
a spot of the latter colour, a little out of the centre,
marks the situation of a remarkable organ called the
madreporiform tubercle, the proper use of which has not
as yet been satisfactorily determined. Just at the extremity
of each angle, but a little below, is situated a
wart of rich crimson hue, which is supposed to be an
eye, being seated on a small ganglionic swelling of a
nerve that passes along the ray. It is true no crystalline
lens has as yet been detected on the pigment dot,
either in this species or any other (for the specks are
found in the same position in all the proper Star-fishes),
but they are manifestly of the same character as similar
specks in <i>Rotifera</i>, and other humble animal forms,
which in some examples are connected with an indubitable
lens. It might seem at first as if the situation
of these eyes were not very favourable to vision; but, in
truth, they command the ground just before and around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the ray-tip, and also the water in a horizontal direction;
and as there is one at each of the five angles, the entire
circumferent space is viewed at each moment. Add to
this, that the animal is in the habit of very frequently
turning up the tip of one or other of its rays, when the
range of vision would take in the zenith; and we shall
perceive that no position in any other part of the body
could be so suitable for the location of eyes as these
selected. It is not to be supposed that distinct definition
of objects is attained by these rudimentary
organs; but the animal is probably conscious of the
difference between light and darkness, and may also
discern the sudden approach of any object, either by
its interception of light, or by its colours, though its
features and form may be indistinct. Such a degree of
visual perception, though very imperfect in our esteem,
may be of great use to this sluggish creature, and amply
sufficient for its need.</p>

<p>The whole upper surface of this Starlet is covered
with six-sided convex plates, each of which is crowned
by a group of short blunt spines; the number in each
group varying from one to nine; four to six, however,
most commonly; arranged in a diverging tuft. Over the
madreporiform tubercle, the tufts are stouter, and bend
towards each other, as if to protect this delicate organ,
which, whatever its function, is grooved with sinuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
furrows, visible only with a considerable magnifying
power, like the rounded masses of coral from the tropical
seas, called brain-stones.</p>

<p>On the under surface similar stout short spines are
arranged in transverse bands across each ray, interrupted,
however, by the central furrow, which is perforated with
two ranges of orifices to give issue to the sucker-feet,
which thus form a double row. These organs do not
differ importantly either in structure, function, or appearance,
from those in the Cross-fishes, in the Sea-cucumbers,
or in the Urchins.</p>

<p>In health and activity the whole upper surface is
covered with a forest of short pellucid tubes, closed at
the tips, which protrude from pores in the plates, and
stand erect, moving, however, to and fro at the will of
the animal; they are evidently filled with fluid. I
cannot find any notice of these organs: they are probably
connected with respiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEA-URCHIN.</div>

<p>What a wonderful piece of mechanism is a Sea-Urchin!
Accustomed as I am to the multitudinous
contrivances and compensations that present themselves
at every turn to the philosophic naturalist, often as surprising
and unexpected as they are beautifully effective,
I am yet struck with admiration at the structure of an
<i>Echinus</i> whenever I examine it anew. A globular
hollow box has to be made, of some three inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
diameter, the walls of which shall be scarcely thicker
than a wafer, formed of unyielding limestone, yet fitted
to hold the soft tender parts of an animal, which quite
fill the concavity at all ages. But in infancy the animal
(and, of course, its box, as this must be full) is not so
big as a pea; and it has to grow till it attain its adult
dimensions. The box is never to be cast off, and replaced
by a new one; the same box must hold the
infant and the veteran Urchin. The limestone, not being
a living tissue, but an inert earth, can grow only by
being deposited. Now the vascular tissues are within,
and the particles they deposit must be on the interior
walls. This would indeed augment the amount of
limestone in the box, but it would be at the expense of
the contained space. The thicker the walls, if thickened
from within, the less room in the cavity; but what
is wanted is <i>more</i> room, ever more, and more. The
growing animal feels its tissues swelling day by day, by
the assimilation of food, and its cry is, “Give me space!
a larger house, or else I die.”</p>

<p>How is this problem solved? Ah! there is no difficulty.
The inexhaustible wisdom of Jehovah the
Creator has invented a beautiful contrivance for the
emergency. The box is not made in one piece, nor in
ten, nor in a hundred; six hundred distinct pieces go
to make up the hollow case; all so accurately fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
together, that the perfect symmetry of the outline is
not broken; and yet, thin as their substance is, they
retain their relative position with unchanging exactness,
and the slight brittle box possesses all requisite strength
and firmness.</p>

<p>Each of these symmetrical pieces of shell is enveloped
by a layer of living flesh, a vascular tissue of exceeding
thinness, which passes up between the joints where one
meets another, on every side, and not only so, but actually
spreads itself over the whole exterior surface. So
that when you take up an Urchin into your hand, and
having rubbed a small space clear of spines, look on it;
you have not, as you may suppose you have, exposed
the surface of the shelly box, but only the flesh that
covers it; yet this is so transparent and colourless, so
inconceivably thin, so absolutely adherent at every
point, that its presence will not be discernible to feeling
or sight, without the aid of high microscopic
powers.</p>

<p>This being so, the glands of the investing fleshy
tissue secrete lime from the sea-water, which holds it
in solution, and constantly deposits it, after a determinate
and orderly pattern, on every part of the surface of
each shelly piece; the inner face, the outer face, and
each of the sides and angles of the polyhedron grow
together, and all so evenly, that while the dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
increase, both of thickness and superficies, the form
characteristic of that individual piece is maintained
with immutable mathematical precision. Thus the
volume and capacity of the box grow with the growth
of the individual segments, and it ever keeps the globose
shape at first imposed upon it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS MECHANISM.</div>

<p>But this is but a small part of the mechanism of this
interesting tribe. If you put into a basin of sea-water
one of the pretty kind<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> which we find so abundantly
under stones at low water,&mdash;whose green spines are
tipped with rosy purple, like the tentacles of an <i>Anthea</i>,&mdash;you
will presently observe it marching majestically
along by means of the hundreds of sucker-feet, which
it possesses in common with the Star-fish. Now, if you
have in your cabinet the empty box of an Urchin of
this same kind, and taking it in your hand, hold it up
to the light, and look into the cavity from the under
or mouth side, you will have a very interesting spectacle.
The light streams in through a multitude of
minute holes, as smooth and regular as if drilled with
a fairy’s wimble; and these holes are arranged in a
pattern of elegant symmetry. They run in lines, like
meridians, from pole to pole of the flattened globe; but
instead of being set at uniform intervals, they constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
five principal sets or bands, with blank intervals between,
about twice as wide as the drilled bands. Then
each band comprises two series, each of which contains
a double row of orifices. These last, again, do not constitute
a single unbroken line, but an interrupted or
zig-zag line, which is, in fact, made up of a number of
short diagonal rows; three holes in each diagonal, set
one after another.</p>

<p>Put the living and the dead together. These tiny
orifices, as minute as the point of the finest cambric-needle
could make in a bit of paper, afford exit to the
suckers, which are, of course, equally numerous. Through
these pass the slender pellucid tubes, filled with elastic
fluid, which carry at their tips a flat ring of calcareous
shell, affording to each the form and firmness to make
each one an adhesive sucking disk, in the centre of
which a tiny vacuum is created at will by muscular
retraction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS SPINES.</div>

<p>But this is not all. Again, look at the living Sea-Urchin.
It bristles with the rosy-tipped spines, which
have a satiny lustre, owing to the reflection of the light
from the delicate ridges and furrows with which the
whole is fluted, like an Ionic column in miniature.
How they are all moving, and swaying to and fro on
their bases, quite independently of each other, however,
making circles and traverses in the water with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
their points, as the mast-heads of a ship do among the
clouds in a gentle swell, when seen from the deck.
Professor Agassiz fell into the egregious blunder of
supposing that the spines were the organs of locomotion
in the Urchins, denying, with much contempt, the
theory which attributed this office to the suckers. One
can only wonder whether he ever saw a living Urchin in
motion, as one moment’s glance at the phenomenon is
sufficient to prove how utterly his theory was false, as
Forbes has well shown.</p>

<p>However, let us once more observe the empty denuded
box from the cabinet; and now on the exterior. Between
the principal bands of pores (called <i>ambulacra</i>,
from their fancied resemblance to walks in a garden),
as also between the two series which constitute each
band, the space is studded with hemispherical warts,
of very diverse size, which look as if turned in ivory,
unpolished; and each wart is crowned with a smaller
wart of like material, but bearing the most perfect
polish.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each spine there is a cavity exactly
fitting this second wart, and equally highly-polished
in its interior. During life the spine was seated on the
wart, not united to it, but moving upon it in all directions,
with perfect smoothness and freedom; a ball and
socket joint, in fact. It was held in its place by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
investment of muscle, which completely enclosed both
the wart and the base of the spine, having one insertion
in the unpolished wart, and the other in a remarkable
ring or shoulder of the spine, visible just above the
socket.</p>

<p>These are but two or three salient points of interest
in the structure of this little unvalued, disregarded
creature. I could relate much more; indeed, I think
it would not be difficult to write a bulky volume of the
history and biography of a single Sea-Urchin, of which
every page would display the glory of God. But I have
not space for that here.</p>

<p>We sometimes, but very rarely, find on this coast a
very lovely form of this class of animals, the Rosy
Feather-star.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> It consists of ten long attenuated arms,
radiating from a common centre, composed each of about
forty slender joints of stone, and each joint carrying a
pair of diverging beards, also many-jointed, all of which
together, by their number and arrangement, give to the
arm the aspect of a beautiful feather. Around the
central point of radiation, a small cup-like body gives
origin to the arms, which are double, a pair springing
from a single basal joint. Within the cup the soft parts
of the animal are chiefly located, the organs of the vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
functions; and from the convex surface spring a number
of jointed stony threads, like necklaces, much shorter
and slenderer than the arms, which serve as claspers,
gripping and holding firmly the projections of the rock,
by means of strong curved claws with which they are
terminated, in shape like those of an eagle.</p>

<p>The whole elegant creature is of a lively rose tint,
interrupted by patches of bright yellow, disposed with
no regularity or apparent order; the whole, both the
yellow and the rosy portions, studded with crimson
dots. Edward Forbes, if I rightly understand him, considers
these dots to be ovaries, which he estimates at
upwards of 57,000 in number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INFANT FEATHER-STAR.</div>

<p>In infancy the Feather-star is seated at the extremity
of a long slender jointed stalk, attached at its lower
end, whence it rises erect, like a plant. Indeed the
whole animal, in this condition, with its cup-like base
and elegantly incurving arms, seated on its tall stem,
has so close a resemblance of outline to a flower, that
the fossil specimens, which are very numerous, and of
large size, are known as Lily-stones, and technically as
<i>Encrinites</i>, which word has the same allusion. After a
while, the radiating portion, or flower, separates from
the stalk, and swims freely, contracting its arms to give
the impulse, in the manner of a <i>Medusa</i>.</p>

<p>Who, on looking at these two creatures side by side,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Sea-Urchin and the Encrinite,&mdash;would imagine
that they possessed any close natural relationship, or
would suspect that they could have been framed on
the same model? Yet it is really so; there is a common
plan of structure in both; pervading, too, many intermediate
forms, which at first sight would seem to manifest
as little resemblance to the one as to the other.
It would, in fact, be easy to select from any well-furnished
museum a continuous chain of specimens,
whose links approach each other so closely as to form
an unbroken series from the Urchin to the Feather-star.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONNECTING LINKS.</div>

<p>Among the Urchins proper there are some species,
such as the Sphere Sea-egg, and the one known as
Fleming’s, which have a figure not far from that of a
globe. Others are much more depressed, of which the
little Purple-tipped is a notable example. Still the
spherical shape is conspicuous. From this rounded
form other species, more and more flattened, gradually
lead to the <i>Scutella</i>, which takes the form of a thin
round plate, quite flat beneath, but slightly convex on
the upper surface. The structure is the same as before,
but the spines appear to the naked eye only as very
minute hairs; but, when magnified, are found to be of
the most elaborate workmanship, each having a movable
socket-joint. In the genus <i>Clypeaster</i>, the round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
outline is changed for a five-sided figure, the angles of
which in succeeding species project more and more, and
the spaces between become more and more indented,
till we arrive at the Starlets, and at length to the Cross-fishes
(<i>Asteriadæ</i>). The rays gradually becoming longer
and more slender, we are brought to those in which
they are so lengthened as to resemble the tails of so
many serpents, whence they are named <i>Ophiura</i>. In
succeeding genera, such as that called Medusa’s head
(<i>Gorgonocephalus</i>), the central part is still further diminished,
and the rays are divided into branches of great
length and number. Each ray, soon after its commencement,
separates into two more; these again into
two others, and so on to an astonishing extent. Upwards
of 2500 ramifications have been counted on a
single specimen, presenting a living net, by the contraction
of which any small animal once touched would
inevitably be detained. The sucker-feet are no longer
found, these animals changing their position by dragging
themselves along by their flexible arms. Finally, we
have the Feather-stars, which, as we have seen, in their
infant condition, and the Lily-stars, which throughout
life (as the abundant fossil species in our own land,
and that noble one which still exists in the West Indian
seas), consist of slender-jointed arms, with feather-like
filaments, seated at the free extremity of a tall jointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
stalk, also furnished with whorls of filaments, which is
fixed by its base to the solid rock.</p>

<p>Altogether, the series presents us with one of the
most instructive and most marvellous examples of the
vast variety of external form and internal structure
which may be assumed by almost insensible modifications
of one plan of organization; and so of the unfathomable
resources of wisdom in the ever-blessed
God. For every one of these links,&mdash;and there are
multitudes which I have not named, found either in
remote seas or in a fossil condition, that fill up the gaps
with close gradations&mdash;displays an essentially common
model; and the least fragment of the stony skeleton of
any one would be sufficient to enable a competent
naturalist to decide authoritatively, the instant he
looked at it beneath his microscope, that it belonged
to the great class <span class="smcap">Echinodermata</span>. The calcareous shell
of which the framework is composed,&mdash;a glass made of
lime,&mdash;is deposited in a fashion which, while common
to all, is found nowhere else throughout the whole
animal kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLAT-CRABS.</div>

<p>Let us turn from these investigations, fascinating as
they are, to examine the ways and means of two or three
other creatures, familiar enough to us who habitually
explore the sea-margin. I allude to certain members
of the great class <span class="smcap">Crustacea</span>, not Crabs nor Lobsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
exactly, but called so by courtesy, something in fact
between both. My dredger’s hauls are always sure
to contain, creeping in the tangled thickets of <i>Laomedea</i>,
<i>Antennularia</i>, and other of the flexible Polyps,
or playing at bo-peep from the interstices of the <i>Serpula</i>
masses,&mdash;numerous specimens of a tiny Crab,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> with a
circular flat shell, no bigger than a split-pea, large wide
claws, and very long antennæ, like two hairs. They
are of various colours, sometimes pure white, sometimes
chocolate-brown, and often clouded with different hues.
Minute as they are, they are not despised by great
fishes; for the heavy-sided, clumsy-headed cods, that
occupy so large an area on the fishmonger’s slab, are
often found to have their stomachs packed full with
these little Crabs; which doubtless the glutton picks
off one by one, enjoying the taste of the savoury atom
as it rolls over his fat fleshy tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR MANNERS.</div>

<p>But we may much more easily procure specimens of
his bigger brother, the Shaggy Flat-crab,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which abounds
under nearly every flat stone at low-water on Babbicombe
beach, and indeed almost everywhere else, under
the like conditions. He is a curious subject, though
far from attractive as to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">personnel</i>, for he is, I regret
to say, of irreclaimably dirty habits. You never find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
him but he is begrimed and saturated, so to speak,
with the impalpable red mud of which our soil consists,&mdash;the
<i>débris</i> of the red sandstone. Yet blame him not.
He is more hirsute than a modern swell; his hands and
his face are as hairy as Esau’s; a dense short pile of
stiff bristles stands out from all his prominences, and
catches and entangles the sediment in the midst of
which he loves to riot. I say again, blame him not;
we must not infer that he likes dirt for its own sake,
because he gets his living in it, any more than the sweep
or the dustman chose his trade because he had a <i>penchant</i>
for the grime. Nay, dirty as our little flat friend
is, he is endowed with organs expressly for the purpose
of cleaning himself, and fails not to use them too. On
first looking at him you would suppose, comparing him
with other Crabs, that he was short of one pair of feet;
yet presently, from a narrow, almost invisible crevice
behind, he jerks out two jointed limbs, as slender
as bristles, which, however, are each terminated by a
tiny two-fingered claw, and are beset throughout
their length by stiff short hairs standing out at right
angles, like a brush. These feeble limbs are indeed
cleansing brushes, with which he keeps certain portions
of his person clean, applying them with the greatest ease
to the whole surface of the abdomen, and under-side of
the carapace or body-shell, while the delicate fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of the little hand are used to pick off adhering matters
that cannot be removed by brushing. Then having done
his washing, he cleans his brushes with his mouth, and
snugly folds them up, and packs them away in their
groove till he wants them again. Yet with all this, he
remains, as I said at first, a dirty subject notwithstanding.</p>

OLIVE SQUAT-LOBSTER.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SHAGGY FLAT-CRAB. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SCARLET SQUAT-LOBSTER.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>A curious chapter in the history of this little creature,
which I have put on record elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> is, I think,
so very instructive, that I may venture to repeat some
parts of it here. Let me premise that the Crab habitually
lives under stones, a habit for which the remarkable
flatness and thinness of all its parts adapts it; he
has somewhat of the appearance of having been crushed
flat by the pressure of the stone under which he lives.
He does not wander much to seek his food, but expects
it to be brought to him, he making provision for its
conveyance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOOD-GATHERING ORGANS.</div>

<p>The organs which he employs for this end are the
outer foot-jaws or pedipalps, which are of unusual
length, and are fringed with incurving hairs. Watching
a Flat-crab beneath a stone close to the side of my
tank, I noticed that his long antennæ were continually
flirted about; these are doubtless sensitive organs of
touch, or some analogous sense, which inform the
animal of the presence, and perhaps of the nature, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
objects within reach. At the same time I remarked
that the outer foot-jaws were employed alternately in
making casts; being thrown out deliberately, but without
intermission, and drawn in, exactly in the manner
of the fringed hand of a barnacle, of which both the
organ and the action strongly reminded me. I looked
at this more closely with the aid of a lens; each foot-jaw
formed a perfect spoon of hairs, which at every
cast expanded, and partly closed. That this may be
better understood, I may say that the foot-jaw resembles
a sickle in form, being composed of five
joints, of which the last four are curved like the blade
of that implement. Each of these joints is set along
its inner edge with a row of parallel bristles, of which
those of the last joint arch out in a semicircle, continuing
the curve of the limb; the rest of the bristles
are curved parallel or concentrical with these, but
diminish in length as they recede downwards. It
will be seen, therefore, that when the joints of the
foot-jaw are thrown out, approaching to a straight line,
the curved hairs are made to diverge; but as the cast
is made, they resume their parallelism, and sweep-in,
as with a net, the atoms of the embraced water. The
microscope revealed to me a still higher perfection in
this admirable contrivance. I then saw that every individual
bristle is set on each side with a row of short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
stiff hairs, projecting nearly at right angles to its
length; these hairs meeting point to point those of the
next bristle, and so on in succession, there is formed a
most complete net of regular meshes, which must enclose
and capture every tiny insect or animalcule that
floats within its range; while, at each out-cast, it opens
at every mesh, and allows all refuse to be washed away
or fall to the ground. For we are not to suppose that
the captures thus promiscuously made are as indiscriminately
swallowed. A multitude of atoms are gathered,
which would be quite unfit for food; and a power of
selection resides in the mouth, whether it be the sense
of taste or touch; or any other analogous but recondite
perception, by which the useful only is admitted, the
worthless, or at least the injurious, being rejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SQUAT-LOBSTERS.</div>

<p>Companions of the Flat-crabs, closely allied to them
in all essentials of form and structure, yet widely separated
by general figure and appearance, and to some
extent by habits too, are the Squat-lobsters. They, too,
are somewhat flat, but they are more decidedly lobster-like,
with a distinctly jointed abdomen as broad as the
body, terminating in wide and strong swimming-plates.
This portion is, during rest, thrown-in under the body,
much more completely than a true lobster or prawn can
do it, and yet is by no means so permanently set in
that position as in the true crabs. The Flat-crabs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the Squat-lobsters constitute an intermediate group
between the short-tailed and the long-tailed Crustacea,
the Flat-crabs inclining to the one, the Squats to the
other alliance. When the abdomen is wrapped-in, the
outline of the Squat is nearly oval, particularly in the
commonest species, the Olive or Scaly Squat.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> That of
the Scarlet or Embleton’s species<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> is a longer ellipse.
The front runs out into several sharp spines, as do also
the edges of the carapace; and the inner edges of the
front limbs, which carry long and stout claws, are very
spiny. More formidably armed in this respect, however,
than either, is another species, found occasionally
at low-water, the Painted or Spinous Squat,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> all the
limbs being set, on both edges, with stout sharp prickles.
The last named is the largest kind, being sometimes
four inches long; then the Olive, which is commonly
from two to two and a half; while the Scarlet rarely
exceeds an inch and a half. They differ very much in
colour, the Olive being of a dull blackish green, with
narrow transverse lines of pale yellowish; the Painted
somewhat of the same general hue, but with the eyes
and the tips of the claws of the most vivid scarlet,
while the body is varied with lines and spots of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
equally brilliant azure. Embleton’s is of a more or
less bright red, varying from a light orange or warm
cream colour to a full orange, clouded with patches of
deep scarlet. The last is an inhabitant of deep water,
obtained only by the dredge; by this means, however,
I obtain it in considerable numbers. The other two
are found, the first abundantly, the second rather rarely,
under stones in our coves. I have found, in autumn,
in such situations, several specimens of small size, rather
smaller than full-grown Embletons, which I conclude
to be the young of the Painted. The whole body is
pale blue, tesselated all over with black and reddish
brown; the legs are banded with red, and the hands
are of the same colour. They have a very pretty
appearance.</p>

<p>The whole race are very cautious and timid. With
the long claws, and the longer antennæ, stretched out
to their utmost in front, the suspicious Squat feels the
unknown ground with delicate touches; should he
touch any object that moves, he gives on the instant a
vigorous flap with the broad incurved tail, and shoots
backward through the water to the distance of several
inches. At the same moment all the legs are thrown
forward in the line of the body, to diminish the resistance.
Mr. Couch says: “It is very remarkable to witness
the accuracy with which they” [he is speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the Painted species specially] “will dart backward <i>for
several feet</i> into a hole very little larger than themselves:
this I have often seen them do, and always with
precision.” This would surely be a remarkable feat for
an animal in the air; how much more through a medium
so dense and resisting as sea-water!</p>

<p>I have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> described and figured the young of
a species of this genus in two of its stages. In the first
it may be compared with a prawn, having a lengthened
slender body, whose fore part is protected by a prawn-like
transparent carapace, with an immensely long
straight spine in front, and two hooked ones behind.
In the next stage the general figure is acquired, but
still the form is more like that of <i>Porcellana</i> than of
<i>Galathea</i>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>



<h2>VIII.<br />

AUGUST.</h2>


<p>What eager pursuer of marine animals has not
gloated over a rock-pool? On all our rocky coasts
we find them more or less developed; but it is on these
south-western shores, where the compact limestone juts
out into promontories, that we find them in perfection.
The burrowing mollusca specially favour the limestone;
the <i>Saxicava</i>, I think, lives in no other medium; and
it is to the operation of this coarse ugly little shell-fish
that this rock is indebted for the honeycomb-like excavation
which has eroded its surface. Below a few
inches this erosion does not extend, for the <i>Saxicava</i> is
but a small animal, and its siphons must reach the orifice
of its burrow; therefore it never goes deeper into
the stone than will allow it comfortably to bathe its
red nose in the free water, though it is not at all particular
about the angle to the surface at which it bores.
The myriads and myriads of these auger-holes that have
been bored remain, though the feeble animals perish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
generation after generation; each new-born shell-fish
makes a new bore for itself, never appropriating one
ready-made, and so there is a perpetual excavation of
the living rock with these shallow auger-holes, always
of the same width, or nearly; about half-an-inch. The
result is what we see; that the surface of the rock
knows no such thing as a plane surface, but a surface
covered with smooth borings, running in all directions,
so as continually to break in on one another; and that
so close together, that the interspaces form narrow
knife-edges, and sharp angles and projecting points.
A particularly interesting circumstance is, that this
honeycombed condition is characteristic not only of
that level of the rock which is covered by the sea for
some portion of every tide, but of that part, to a certain
height, which is never covered at all. The Mollusca, it
is true, cannot live wholly deprived of sea-water, and,
in fact, there are none in this ever-dry portion, though
the burrows by thousands testify that they were there
once. We must infer that the coast has been generally
elevated; perhaps by slow and imperceptible degrees, by
an operation still proceeding but unappreciated; perhaps
by some sudden convulsion which took place at a
remote era, unrecorded and forgotten.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW ARE ROCK-POOLS MADE?</div>

<p>When once raised beyond the level of the highest
tide, the eroded surface appears to have a permanency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
which defies the action of the elements for an undefinable
period; for it seems liable to little change. It is
probably comparatively unalterable, or alterable slowly,
beneath the level of the lowest tide. But between tide-marks,
the perpetual change from wetness to dryness
and back again, and the incessant wash of the waves,
which frequently beat and dash upon the eroded surface
with immense violence, are continually grinding
down the projecting points and thin walls of stone, and
thus creating a new surface, to be bored afresh by new
generations of Mollusca.</p>

<p>It has seemed to me that these burrows have played
and are playing an important part in the formation of
the numberless rocky basins which we call tide-pools,
and in which we marine naturalists so much delight.
Let us look at the process. About half-tide level there
is a mass of bored rock, from whose burrows the tenants
are dying out for want of sufficiently long water-covering.
A heavy sea is breaking over it, which has snapped off
the thin partition beneath two contiguous burrows,
breaking it into several sharply angular bits, which fall
into the hole. The whirling and eddying of the waves
rattle and roll these fragments round and round day
after day, week after week, till at last they are ground
to nothing: but an equal effect has been produced
on the hollow which held them; its cavity has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
widened and deepened by the same grinding action.
By-and-by a pebble is rolled in, and being almost large
enough to fill the cavity, it does not readily wash out,
but grinds round and round with the motion of the sea.
So the process goes on, perhaps for centuries, perhaps
with long intervals of almost sameness; every stone
that is washed-in enlarging the work; while, when
once the hollow has become only ever so little larger
or deeper than those which surround it, the pebbles
will have an increasing tendency to roll in and to stay
there. So, at length, the basin is formed, tiny at first;&mdash;I
know scores not so big as a slop-bowl, which yet have
their furniture of elegant little sea-weeds, green and
purple, and their tenants of worms, and shrimps, and
polyps;&mdash;but destined by-and-by to become noble
reservoirs in which man may pleasantly bathe, and in
which little fishes play and shoot to and fro, and hide
under the umbrageous fronds of the oar-weed and tangle
that droop gracefully into the ample cavity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORKWING.</div>

<p>In the pleasant sunny afternoons of this season of
the year we may find in tolerable abundance the pretty
Cork-wing,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in such rock-pools as I have been speaking
of. In the shallow hollows of the ledges they shoot
hither and thither, the swift movement just catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the collector’s eye; but here they are difficult to capture,
owing to the numerous exits and hiding-places among
the stones. The deeper basins are pretty sure of containing
one or two, and generally of larger size. Here
the dip-net can be brought into action, and they are
readily taken. But the finest specimens are obtained
around the edges of the rocks in the free water, and
where there is considerable depth. Here the attentive
eye discerns them quietly hovering, some yard or two
beneath the surface, deliberately picking their tiny
crustacean food from the drooping weeds, or playing
to and fro in little parties of half-a-dozen, on motionless
or gently undulating fins; a pretty sight to watch.
From these seaward edges of the rocks the coarser sea-weeds
growing in a thick fringe, when the tide has left
them partly exposed, hang their tips in the heaving
water; and under this grateful shelter the little Corkwings,
as well as other small fishes, their companions,
delight to disport themselves, finding copious food in
the purple obscurity, and getting many a peep through
the latticed leaves at their idler fellows in gamesome
play without. If, now, the collector have provided
himself with a stiff ring-net, and a long and stout
handle, he may sift out, as it were, the tenants of these
shades, by collecting, in succession, the drooping weed-tips
in the mouth of his net, and lifting it gently through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
them; when the lovely little emerald fishes will be
found, two or three at each dip, struggling and panting
and leaping and quivering their helpless fins at the
bottom of his bag.</p>

CORKWING WRASSE.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Corkwing belongs to the great Wrasse family;
which, though it chiefly develops itself in the tropical
seas, is yet well represented in our own. Yarrell has
figured thirteen species, all of them found on our south-western
shores, and a few of them ranging to the north
as well. The entire family is remarkable for its bright
and gorgeous hues, often taking the form of bands,
stripes and spots, well defined, and in vivid contrasts.
This little species, which extends to the length of five
inches, but is much more commonly taken not more
than half that size, is of a rich emerald-green hue,
lighter beneath, and generally marked with a conspicuous
black spot on each side of the base of the tail.
Small individuals are frequently found, of a dark
reddish brown, arranged in a minute tesselated pattern
on a pale ground; and occasionally of a rich golden
bronzed hue. The eyes are usually of the finest
vermilion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIGURES OF WRASSES.</div>

<p>They are entertaining inmates of an aquarium; they
play slowly up and down in the corners of the tank,
exploring every angle and cranny, hanging in every
possible attitude, especially at night. They soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>come
familiar, and may be preserved in health a long
time. They are constantly occupied in searching for,
and picking off atoms, invisible to us, with their protrusile
lips. These organs are remarkably large, thick,
and fleshy, whence has been derived the name of the
family, <i>Labridæ</i> (from <i>labrum</i>, a lip); and, in death,
they are generally projected in an uncouth and repulsive
form. It is a pity that Yarrell’s figures have been
for the most part copied from specimens in this distorted
condition, and are therefore hideous caricatures
of the little beauties. His Corkwing is a notable
example, presenting but little resemblance to the
playful emerald in my tank; while the Gilthead and
the Sea-wife are still more horrible. It is matter of
regret that so large a portion of our pictorial natural
history represents death rather than life; while a herd
of slavish compilers, who have never seen the creatures
on which they obtrude their teachings, copy such imperfect
figures, and copy each other, and go on augmenting
the distortions, and straying farther and farther
from nature, till all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> is lost in the ludicrous
caricature.</p>

<p>In a former work<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> I have narrated the untimely fate
of one of these pretty fishes in my possession, through
the poison-darts of a Parasitic Anemone.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> A similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
accident befell one lately, which I had kept in my tank
for about two months. This individual, about two
and a half inches long, active and healthy, made a
backward spring, and came in contact with the tentacles
of an <i>Anthea cereus</i>, which in an instant enveloped its
hinder half, clinging round and over it and quite covering
that portion. I was looking on, and after a moment’s
glance to see that the fish was perfectly helpless, I
removed it with a stick, so that it was free in about
half a minute from its accident. But the effect was
manifest; it swam away indeed, but irregularly and
fitfully, and presently sank down on the bottom; lay
awhile, then struggled up for a few seconds, swimming
on one side, as if partly paralysed, and frequently
turning over belly-up; then sinking obliquely down
and hiding its nose between the stones. The fins were
white and ragged, and the skin of the hinder part was
ruffled up in parts, and the entire hind-half looked
diseased. By night it was not to be seen; but the
next morning I found it, dead and stiff, and with the
whole of the parts that had been embraced by the
Anthea turned of a pellucid white, the edges of the fins
sloughed away and decomposing.</p>

<p>When we consider that the entire period of contact
was no more than half a minute, the power of the subtle
poison, injected by the <i>cnidæ</i> of the Opelet, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
very manifest; and the accident afforded me another
confirmation of what has been fondly denied, the
amazing energy of the poison-apparatus in the <span class="smcap">Actinozoa</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUCKY PROACH.</div>

<p>An assiduous searching of these hanging fringes of
fuci will be sure to yield a pleasing return of other
objects. Neglecting at this moment the Prawns, Æsops,
Opossum-shrimps, Spider-crabs, and many other <i>crustacea</i>,
not to speak of other classes, let us direct our
thoughts exclusively to the fishes. You will get probably
one or two specimens of that little bull-headed
rogue, the Father-lasher,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> armed at all points, like a
knight in the fair time of chivalry. An impudent little
rascal he looks, and right villanous; but whether he is
in truth guilty of whipping his paternal parent, this
deponent saith not. Big-headed, wide-mouthed, staring-eyed,
beset on all sides with hard spines as sharp as
needles, which he erects with threatening fierceness as
he anticipates your touch, this Lucky Proach, as our
northern friends name him, may not invite a close
acquaintance; and indeed our fishermen generally jerk
him energetically out of the net as soon as they see
him, thinking themselves “lucky” to be well quit of his
prickles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS HABITS.</div>

<p>Yet in truth he makes a funny little tenant of the
aquarium. His colours are agreeable; deep rich brown
on the upper parts, fantastically patched and clouded
with various shades from black to pure white, while the
sides and belly are brilliantly silvery or opalescent.
His countenance expresses considerable intelligence;
and the contrast between his aspect when he is alarmed,
and all his spines are laid flat, and when he thinks to
carry his point by bullying, and bristles up all his sharp
lances, and glares with a threatening goggle, is very
amusing. He presently becomes at home; for a day
or two he skulks under the rocky ledges, and you see
little of him; but soon his characteristic impudence
reassures him, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vires acquirit eundo</i>; he makes short
hasty sallies into the open, and instantly scuttles back
to his retreat; presently you see his great head projecting
out of some crevice in the rocks, whence he can
command a pretty extensive view; and now that is his
selected home, and there henceforward you may pretty
surely find him, whenever he is not to be seen engaged
in predatory forays in some other quarter of the tank.
Now he grows very saucy; not a Blenny or Goby or
Pipe can come before his castle-gate but Proach must
dash out to have a passage-of-arms with him, returning,
in all the pride of conquest, when he has driven
the routed foe out of sight, to his rocky fortress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
settling himself in the same watchful attitude as before.
Every atom of meat that you drop into the water within
his range of vision must be his: you perhaps intended
the morsel for the Goby or the Blenny, but Proach sees
it, and Proach must have it. They indeed may sail up
towards the speck, but Proach dashes up, bristling with
indignation at their temerity, and snaps the food from
before their very noses. Not one of them can get a bit
till Proach is satiated; and I have often seen him lie
with a morsel projecting from his mouth for some time,
absolutely incapable of swallowing more, before he
would relinquish the contest. Now he fears nothing;
he will even rush to the surface when he sees you
approaching, and, with a sudden snap, seize the meat
in your fingers, and drag it away.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Q. Couch gives us some interesting particulars
of this little fish, or his brother, the Sea-scorpion; for
they are so much alike, both in appearance and manners,
that some naturalists do not recognise any specific difference
between them. “When caught,” he says, “it
makes a croaking kind of noise; opens its gill-covers,
and erects the spines of its head, and stiffens its whole
body, as if prepared for a vigorous defence. The spines
are covered with a skin or sheath, which the creature
has the power of drawing from the points and leaving
them bare. This fish will live a long time out of water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
provided it be kept slightly wet, but soon dies on immersion
in fresh water. Those fish that swim deeply
are able to sustain life much longer than those that
swim near the surface; and the former are more sluggish
in their movements, and require less aërated water
for respiration. The more active are surface-swimmers.
The immersion in fresh water acts as a poison, death
not resulting from any variation in the respirable quality
of the water. If a Sea-scorpion, after being taken from
the sea, be constantly kept wet with salt water, it will
live for a considerable time, the gill-covers acting as if
surrounded by water. If the gills be kept wet and the
skin dry, the creature gets restless, croaks, the gills
move less rapidly than before, and it then dies at an
earlier period than when kept altogether moist. If the
gills be wetted with fresh water well aërated, life is
not so long retained, but the fish seems more active
for a time, and dies at last almost in a state of
plethora.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>According to Yarrell, “this species spawns in January,
and the ova at that time are very large and of a fine
orange-yellow colour. These are deposited near the
sea-shore, frequently in the estuaries, and sometimes
even in rivers; the fish having prepared itself for this
change by its previous residence in the brackish water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
after which it appears to be able to bear either extreme.
Its food is small crustaceous animals, and it is said to be
particularly partial to feeding on the fry of the Blennies.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESPIRATION OF FISHES.</div>

<p>On the subject of its instant death, when removed
from its native element to fresh water, the same naturalist
remarks, alluding to the hypothesis that the speedy
death of fishes in general, when removed into the atmosphere,
is due to the drying of the delicate membranes of
the gills; “the reverse of desiccation takes place in this
instance: the gills are bathed with a fluid containing
more oxygen than sea-water, and which also yields that
oxygen much easier, yet death happens immediately.
In this last instance it may be inferred that the fish,
unable suddenly to accommodate its respiratory organs
to fluids of such different densities as those of pure sea
and fresh water, the blood is imperfectly aërated, the
brain is affected, convulsions ensue, and if not released
it soon dies.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>You will pretty certainly find in your net, too, twining
and writhing about like little snakes, some of the
smaller species of Pipe-fishes, often called Sea-adders,
and most abundantly the smallest of them, and the
commonest in shallow waters,&mdash;the Worm Pipe.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
pretty Æquoreal Pipe, or as Mr. Couch appropriately
names it, the Painted Sea-adder (from the variegated
tints of brown and yellow, wherewith its numerous
angular plates are individually adorned), is abundant
enough all along our southern coast, in deeper water,
affecting the extensive beds of zostera, and of sea-weeds,
which in many places clothe the bottom. The eminent
Cornish zoologist observes of this species, that “in May
and June, and frequently in July, and occasionally in
August, these fish rise to the surface of the water, however
deep it may be, and bask themselves in the sun.
They retain their position at the surface by clasping with
their tails the cords and buoys of the crab-pots, sticks,
or any other substance they may find floating at the surface.
The whole of the caudal portion of the body is
coiled round the stick or cord, and the heads lie either
horizontally or at right angles to the surface. In some
seasons the buoy-ropes of the crab-pots are literally
obscured by them from the surface of the water down
as far as the eye can penetrate.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIPE-FISHES.</div>

<p>The little Worm Pipe may also lay claim to the title
of “painted;” for its anterior parts especially are generally
marked with spots of pure white bounded by a
border of black, while the cheeks and throat are covered
with a delicate flush of purple. The habit mentioned
by Mr. Couch of curling the tip of the tail around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
objects in the water is manifested quite as strongly by
this more slender and more flexible species, which does
not possess any trace of a fin at the tail-tip. This
prehensile organ is in a moment whipped round the
stem of any sea-weed or similar object with which it
comes into contact; and thus moored, the pretty Pipe
throws its little body into all sorts of elegant contortions,
hanging freely down, or elevating itself almost
perpendicularly, at pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The fins in this genus of fishes are very small and
feeble. Some of them have a pair of excessively minute
pectorals, an almost invisible anal, and a tiny fan for a
caudal. All have a short delicate dorsal, and several
have no other fin than this, of which section the Worm
Pipe is an example. Yet, according to the Swedish
naturalist, Fries, the young of this species possess at
their birth both caudal and pectorals, the former extending
far up on the body, both on the dorsal and
ventral edges. All these are in after life absorbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
except sufficient to form the permanent dorsal. This
fin, in the whole family, is excessively filmy, and is,
during the action of swimming, fluttered with a very
rapid screw-like vibration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PERSECUTED PIPE.</div>

<p>Slight as are the organs of motion, they are sufficient
for the Pipe-fish’s ordinary exigencies; and Mr. Patterson
has recorded an interesting example of their capability
to achieve movements of an unusual kind. He had
captured the finest of our species,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which he had committed
to a basin of sea-water. “One of the long-bodied
crustacea, which are abundant during fine weather, and
had been captured at the same time, was placed in the
same vessel. It was a species of <i>Gammarus</i>, and about
an inch in length. The <i>Gammarus</i> would seem to have
got tired of swimming, and, for a resting-place, it fixed
itself on the back of the Pipe-fish, close to the tail. The
fish had not been a consenting party to this arrangement,
and soon evinced its dissatisfaction, by lashing
the tail with great violence on each side, to dislodge
the intruder. He, however, kept his hold; and so soon
as the fish ceased for a few seconds, he crept a little
further up on the back, as if aware that the velocity of
movement was less near the centre of the circle. The
fish lashed the water again with great violence, but
without any good result; and so soon as it stopped, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
<i>Gammarus</i> crept up a little nearer to the head. The
<i>Gammarus</i> seemed to be the marine prototype of the
old Man of the Mountain, whose pertinacity, in retaining
his place on the back of Sinbad the Sailor, is a portion
of that lore of our boyhood, that is never afterwards
forgotten. The Pipe-fish then changed its tactics. Instead
of lashing with its tail, it gave to its whole body
the kind of movement it might have had if fixed on a
Lilliputian spit, and in the act of being roasted. The
body was made to revolve round and round on its
longitudinal axis; but the <i>Gammarus</i> still held on, and,
at each interval of rest, made a few steps further in
advance. This was more than once repeated, until,
pitying the poor Pipe-fish, we removed the cause of its
annoyance to another vessel.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Among these pleasing little fishes some very remarkable
deviations from the ordinary economy of animals
occur, though not quite unique. In almost all the
Mammalia of Australia, as is well known, the female
has an external pouch or false belly, into which the
young is transferred at a very early period of embryonic
life, and there matured. In the <i>Pipa</i>, or Surinam Toad,
the eggs are laid by the female, and placed on the
broad back of the male, cells being then formed in
the skin, which receive the eggs till they are hatched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Somewhat like the latter is the case of the Pipe-fishes,
among which it is the male that acts as wet-nurse.
Along his belly runs a groove, formed by two flaps of
skin, within which the eggs, when laid by the female,
are placed, and in which they are safely carried till the
birth of the infant fry.</p>

<p>How wondrously diversified are the modes ordained
by the Divine Wisdom for maintaining the economy
of creation! What a depth is there in that revelation
concerning the everlasting Son, “in whom we have
redemption,”&mdash;that “all things were created by Him,
and for Him, and He is before all things, and by Him
all things <i>hold together</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνέστηκε</span>).”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BUTTERFLY BLENNY.</div>

<p>I have taken in similar circumstances a little fish
which is considered very rare on our shores, the Butterfly
Blenny.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The Mediterranean coasts of Europe are
its proper home, where it resorts to the tufts of weeds,
feeding on minute <i>Crustacea</i> and <i>Mollusca</i>. Yarrell
cites three examples as having been obtained by dredging
off South Devon, and one from which his own
figure was taken, which was obtained among the rocks
of Portland. As he alludes to no other British examples,
he probably knew of no more. Mr. R. Q. Couch, in his
<i>Notes on the Fishes of the Land’s End</i>, says, “A single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
specimen of this fish was taken by a trawl-net in 1845,
but the spot on the first dorsal fin was so obscure as
scarcely to be noticed.”</p>

<p>It is therefore with the more satisfaction that I can
record the possession of two specimens, one taken in
Weymouth Bay from deep water, the other among the
hanging weeds of this shore. Both were in full development
and high colour, the spot on the fin from which
both the specific and the popular names are derived,
strongly marked, so that I am enabled to give a representation
of this interesting fish in its vivid hues, as it
appears in life and health.</p>

<p>The form is thick-set, as is that of the other more
common species of the genus; the forehead is, however,
rounded and less abrupt, which imparts to it a different
physiognomy. The fins are ample, with the exception
of the ventrals, which in all this genus consist of two
rays each; the pectorals very large, nearly circular,
transparent and colourless, with pearly rays. The dorsal
is divided into two portions, of which the first is elevated
like a tall sail, the first ray standing up a long
way beyond the membrane. Its colour is smoke-brown,
deeper at the summit; towards the hind end of this
portion there is a large round black spot, surrounded
by a well-defined pale ring; very conspicuous, indeed,
in my specimens, and strikingly suggestive of the eye-spots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
in the wings of many butterflies and moths. As
if conscious of its beauty, the fish travels <i>with all sail
set</i>, and thus shows its characteristic mark to advantage.</p>

<p>The body is varied with different hues of brown,
black, and grey, the deeper colours forming transverse
bands on the upper parts; while along each side run two
rows of spots of pearly azure, defined by a dark edge.</p>

<p>Just in front of each eye there is a small appendage
which looks like a small horn, with the tip and edge
cut into segments; it is but a projection of the skin.
Several other species of the genus have similar ornaments
on various parts of the face and head: I have no
conception of their use in the economy of the tribe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHANNY.</div>

<p>There is a curious peculiarity in the eye of this fish,
which I do not perceive in the Shanny, nor in any other
species. On looking cursorily at it, you would suppose
that it had a very widely-opened pupil, surrounded by
a white line, which appears to be the interior edge of
the iris. But on watching it with a lens, the whole of
this dark area within the white circle is seen to be
prominent, convex, and opaque, of a substance which
reflects the richest metallic lustre, sometimes turquoise
blue, but changing in other lights to a bronzed or
gilded appearance; not, however, as if burnished, but
as if dusted with metal filings. In the centre of this
area a pupil alternately opens and closes, expanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
and contracting circularly, with a regular systole and
diastole, a little more quickly than the periodic opening
and shutting of the gill-covers, but nearly corresponding
therewith. The contraction of this pupil is perfect, so
as completely to conceal it, and the expansion is irregular
in extent, though regular in time; sometimes it is but
just perceptible, when the next opening will be as wide
as usual. Occasionally, the motion ceases, the area
displaying no trace of a pupil.</p>

<p>Mr. Ross of Topsham, an excellent marine zoologist,
has observed a highly curious habit in the commonest
of the Blennies. It is the Smooth Shan, Shanny, or
Tansy,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> of our southern shore-bays. I was aware that
these little fishes were capable of enduring with impunity
a protracted exposure to the air, which would
be fatal to many, but I did not suppose that the habit
was normal and constant. The facts reported are of
great interest.</p>

<p>“A specimen of the fish,” says Mr. Ross, “was brought
to me on the 3d of June. On placing it in a glass
vessel of sea-water, it appeared perfectly quiet for some
hours, but at length became restless, and made frequent
attempts to throw itself out of the water. It then
occurred to me, that on a former occasion, when by the
sea-side, I had a Gattoruginous Blenny, in a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
with some Actiniæ and Serpulæ, which regularly passed
a portion of its time on a stone; I therefore placed one
in the glass. The <i>Blennius pholis</i> immediately leaped
on it completely out of the water. It therefore appears
that these changes are necessary to its existence. On
going to the front of the house, I perceived that it was
near low water. Knowing that it would flow till ten
o’clock that night, I watched the movements of my
little captive, and as the clock struck, had the gratification
of seeing it plunge again into its natural element.
It has now been more than five months in my possession,
and has proved throughout that period a regular
and correct tide-indicator. I was well aware that these
fish are constantly left by the receding tide on the
rocks, remaining concealed in small basins or holes,
under the weed, till the returning flood; still I was not
prepared to see a fish voluntarily quit the water, and
pass so large a portion of its existence in a different
element, and by instinct alone time its change of position
so exactly.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>This is a highly curious observation; but, as to Mr.
Ross’s inference that “these changes are necessary to its
existence,” I may remark that I have been in the habit
of keeping the Shanny for long periods in my tanks,
without any opportunity for such alternations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FRECKLED GOBY.</div>

<p>I catch at the same time, and at the same place, but
under different conditions, a tiny fish of the same
family, possessing remarkable delicacy of appearance.
It is the Freckled Goby of Yarrell, Spotted Goby of
Pennant, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le Boulereau blanc</i> of the French, the Polewig,
and the Pollybait of the Thames fisherman.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Yarrell
tells us that it is most plentiful in the Thames, doubtless
coming up with the tide, for I do not think it would
live with the admixture of any great quantity of fresh
water. It is used for the baiting of the hook in the
line-fishing, like most other minute fishes that can be
taken in sufficient numbers, and with sufficient certainty,
by means of the net.</p>

<p>Here I find it in the wide pools that lie in the hollows
of the ledges, with a bottom of sand, and not more
than an inch or two of water. Under an August sun
this becomes, during the three or four hours that the
receding sea of spring-tides leaves it, quite tepid; often
standing at blood-heat, or even higher. In these shallows
the Freckled Goby lies, companion of the Sand-shrimp,
which in size, translucency, and colouring, it
closely resembles. It remains quite still, as if conscious
of its safety-point, for it is with difficulty visible, even
if your eye is resting on the very spot; what little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
colour it has being exactly that of the surrounding
sand. When danger comes too close, it shoots to another
part, and you detect that something indistinct passed
rapidly along; it does not, however, habitually seek the
shelter of the fringing weeds, as a Prawn would, but
suddenly becomes still in the open space, settling close
down upon the sand, just as the Shrimps do. It is
rather harder to capture than one would suppose; but I
find the surest way is to place the mouth of the net
obliquely on the bottom, a few inches in front of the
fish, without disturbing him; then, approaching him
with my hand from behind, he leaps in and is secured.
When taken it is a pretty and attractive little species;
very pellucid, showing the stomach and intestine quite
plainly through the muscles, as a dark mass; and even
the brain, which also is darkish, probably from the
number and fulness of the blood-vessels which supply
that important organ. This apparition of the internal
viscera in a vertebrate animal strikes one as something
unusual and remarkable.</p>

<p>The entire surface of this translucent and almost
colourless body is studded with minute specks of rust-red,
and with still smaller ones of opaque pale yellow,
which are visible only with the aid of a lens. Nothing
can be more sand-like than this aggregation of red and
yellow dots, and surely we must look upon it, in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
with the habits of the little feeble fish, as a
special provision for its safety, ordained by Him whose
tender mercies are over <i>all</i> His works. The eyes are
very prominent, and set in very thick and dark orbits;
the pupil is surrounded by a crimson iris. Great
size and prominence of the eyes is quite characteristic
of the fishes of this family. It may be that their
habitual residence in the shallows exposes them peculiarly
to the attacks of enemies; and the size of
the eye may be connected with a greater power or
quickness of sight, indicating a proportionate development
of the optic nerve. But this is only a
conjecture.</p>

<p>The pectorals, as usual, are large, but quite colourless,
and hence can scarcely be discerned, or only like a
film of clear talc. The two dorsals are ordinarily carried,
when at rest, depressed quite down to the back,
but are elevated in swimming. The tail is crossed
vertically by bands of red dots. Like most of the sand-loving
creatures, the Freckled Goby does not long survive
captivity in a tank. Perhaps, however, this may
be because our aquariums are not specially arranged
with a view to their instincts. A very wide shallow
vessel, with a bottom of sand, and a piece or two of
rough rock for shadow, stocked with Freckled Gobies,
Weavers, Sand-launces, Shrimps, Venuses, Naticas, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
might do well. But these will not do with an ordinary
collection of rock-loving things.</p>

<p>What Crantz says of the coast of Greenland is not
less true of our own rocky sea-margins. “These shores
are the best and grandest school for the study of fishes.
Here the naturalist may attain a fundamental acquaintance
with them, and discover the nature and instincts
of each species. It would prove a spacious field of
observation for a curious, inquiring mind, which would
often fall into a train of profound meditation, as he
surveyed the nature and function and relations of the
inhabitants of the vast ocean, from the minutest insect,
scarce perceptible to the eye, to the monstrous whales,
together with the seemingly fabulous great sea-monsters,
and the equally inconceivable zoophytes, or” [as then
supposed] “half-animal sea productions. Yet, after all,
the most speculative and penetrating human mind will
never be able to pry so deep into the manifold wisdom
of God in his creatures as to search them out to perfection;
even the meanest of them, and such as are
before every one’s eyes. But, for that very reason, because
we are so imperfect, we are never satiated with
the study of nature, nor weary of rendering that praise
to the Lord of Nature which He expects from His
creatures.”</p>

<h2>IX.<br />

SEPTEMBER.</h2>


<p>Good service was done to the cause of science when,
some fifteen or twenty years since, Robert Ball of
Dublin invented the naturalist’s dredge. A huge unwieldy
form of the implement has indeed been long in
use among fishermen for the obtaining of oysters and
scallops; a clumsy affair, of which the frame, furnished
only with a single lip, was four or five feet wide, and
the bag was formed of iron rings, two inches in diameter,&mdash;a
loose and open sort of chain-mail. There was an
object in this last arrangement; for while the chain-work
retained all oysters of a marketable size, the
meshes allowed all to escape which were of less dimensions,
and so these remained on the ground to grow
bigger for another season.</p>

<p>Naturalists did gladly avail themselves of this uncouth
apparatus, and many valuable things were scraped
from the sea-bottom thereby; but they never could
have used it without regret at the thought of the thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>sands
of unknown and unimagined treasures which
must have slipped through those huge meshes. No
object of less size than two inches in any diameter had
a chance of being brought to the surface; and how
many precious specimens range below these dimensions
we are now beginning to discover.</p>

<p>Yes; I’m glad I have got a Ball’s dredge; and this
fair autumnal morning I mean to use it; to go out with
honest Harvey, and scrape the stony sea-bottom in the
offing yonder. It is a nice portable affair, that one
hand can manage; eighteen inches by four and a half
are the dimensions of the frame; the scraping lips are
double, one on each edge, so that, however the dredge
falls on the bottom, it is sure to scrape; a double bridle
from each side meets in a ring to which the rope is
made fast; and the bag, some twenty inches deep, is
made of stout twine, well netted, with meshes about
half an inch in diameter. Owing to the swelling of the
twine in the water, there is scarcely anything of value
that will escape such a net.</p>

<p>Harvey has carried down everything to Babbicombe
Beach, and now all is on board; dredge, sieve, pans,
buckets, jars, bottles, <i>ad libitum</i>. And now we run up
the mainsail and jib, and with a light westerly breeze
and smooth water, lie up for Exmouth, or a little beyond,
for about an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DREDGING.</div>

<p>Now we have made our offing, and can look well into
Teignmouth Harbour, the bluff point of the Ness some
four miles distant, scarcely definable now against the
land. We pull down sails, set her head for the Orestone
Rock, and drift with the tide. The dredge is
hove overboard, paying out some forty fathoms of line,
for we have about twelve or fourteen fathoms’ water
here, with a nice rough, rubbly bottom, over which, as
we hold the line in hand, we feel the iron lip of the
dredge grate and rumble, without catches or jumps.
Now and then, for a brief space, it goes smoothly, and
the hand feels nothing; that is when a patch of sand
is crossed, or a bed of zostera, or close-growing sea-weeds,
each a good variation for yielding.</p>

<p>“What d’ye say, Tom? Shall we try it?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p>Up comes the wet line under Tom’s strong muscular
pulling, and as it leaves his hands, we coil it snug
in the bows of the boat. Dimly appears the dredge
some yards below the surface, and now it comes to light,
and is fairly lifted aboard. “’Tis mortal heavy!” Well
it may be, for here is a pretty cargo of huge, rough
stones, great oyster-shells, and I know not what. Bright
scarlets and crimsons and yellows I discern, and many
a twinkling movement among the chaos raises our expectations
of something good. We pick out the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
conspicuous things, and now turn the whole contents
bodily on this old shutter, which we have laid across
two thwarts. ’Tis done; and now heave the dredge over
again, and we are free to work at the mass with all our
eyes and fingers.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes attention from its size and
brilliant colours is a great Sun-star.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> This is a noble
example of the Star-fish family, not uncommon off
these shores. The disk of this specimen is two inches
and a half wide, and the rays, which are here eleven in
number (more commonly twelve) are one and three-fourths
long, so that the total diameter of this fine
creature is six inches. The upper surface is convex
and cake-like, but can be plumped up at pleasure.
Both disk and rays are studded with small whitish
knobs, which seem simple to the eye, but when magnified
are seen to be formed of short and close-set
spines. They are not regularly arranged on the rays
any more than on the disk. Slightly elevated ridges
connect the knobs, thus covering the whole surface with
a raised network.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="PLATE25"></a>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SUN-STAR.</div>

<p>The general colour of the disk is a fine rose-pink,
deeper on a circular area in the centre; the network is
a deeper rose, especially just around the bases of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
knobs. The base of each ray is crossed by a broad
band of pure white, both knobs and network. The
remainder of the rays is of a pale orange-scarlet, becoming
more truly scarlet in the middle portion; the
network of the same hue, but deeper. Over the entire
surface the areas of the net are occupied by series of ovate
whitish hollows, from each of which protrudes a minute
clear bladder or closed tube, exactly like those we lately
saw in the little Starlet. The madreporic plate is seen
about midway between the centre and one of the angles,
as a tiny cake-shaped white body, grooved exactly like
a brain-stone.</p>

<p>Beneath, the rays are ploughed with a deep groove,
in which are two rows of sucker-feet; towards the tip,
however, their place is supplied by long slender pointed
tentacular processes. The avenues are bordered by
flat knobs, set like the edging-stones of a garden walk,
each of which carries five or six spines radiating like
a fan, <i>lengthwise</i>. Each set sends off a branch which
carries another fan placed <i>transversely</i>, of six to ten
spines. Then the white satiny skin sends up at the
very edge of the ray short stems, each bearing a group
of fifteen to twenty spines, having a tendency to a
transverse arrangement, but not in a single row. These
form the edges of the rays, seen from above and below.
At the bases of the rays beneath, the angle terminates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in a broad plate, which is cut into a comb of about
eighteen flat spines, the whole having a semi-oval outline,
projecting towards the mouth. At the tip of each
avenue we discern the little scarlet eye, well protected
by the crowding rows of fans.</p>

<p>The mouth gapes, and gives an unexpected insight
into the diet of this gaily-painted gentleman. We see
a bit of an Echinus shell, and on taking hold of it with
a pair of pliers, and carefully dragging, lo! forth comes
the entire box of a Purple-tipped Urchin, nearly an
inch in diameter, empty of course, through the force of
Mr. Sun’s gastric juice, and denuded of spines. Ugh!
the cannibal! to eat his own first cousin!</p>

<p>We put him into a shallow pan of water, where he
crawls slowly. He is fond of curling the rays over his
back, so as nearly to meet, perhaps to have a look at
the new world in which he finds himself. Then he
turns himself right over in the shallow water, bathing
the under surface in the air, the suckers moving all the
time to and fro with great rapidity, and (we fancy) with
enjoyment.</p>

<p>Several specimens of the common Cross-fish occur,
large and richly coloured, and many of the Urchin just
named; but these we can find every day in-shore; so
they are contemptuously thrown over the gunwale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRANULATE BRITTLE-STAR.</div>

<p>Ha! here is a fine thing! It is the Granulate Brittle-star,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
a species said to be widely spread, but I never
saw it before. It is confined to deep water. It is a
very fine imposing species, reminding me (a strange
comparison, you will say!) of the great South American
hairy Spiders, with a brown body and long bristly legs
sprawling over a width of eight or ten inches. Its hues
are said to be various, but I will describe this as I
see it.</p>

<p>The disk is a plump cushion slightly depressed in
the centre, of a light reddish umber, or sand-brown.
The base of each ray is rich red-brown, the colour
encroaching on the disk with two points, and running
down the medial line of the ray. This hue is bordered
by velvety black, blending with it; and beyond the
middle of the ray, the deepening brown is pretty well
lost in the black. The ray is edged with spines standing
out at right angles, and set in rows. These spines
are black with grey points, and greatly augment the
noble aspect of the creature. Each ray is about four
and a half inches long, running off to a fine point.</p>

<p>The animal resents being turned over, and refuses to
lie in a supine position, unlike the “malus pastor”
of the poet. It curls and twists the slender ray-tips,
crawls rapidly, and courses round and round the edge
of the pan into which we have dropped it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>Let me anticipate here to narrate the after history of
my captive. Consigned to a shallow tank at home,
after a few days I missed him one morning, and on
searching the whole room carefully, found him at length
under the edge of the hearth-rug, some yards from the
tank, with all his rays broken into many pieces, and
only the short stumps remaining. Though dry and
apparently dead, I perceived a slight movement in the
stumps, which gave me hope of revival, and I replaced
the poor maimed thing, sadly shorn of his glory, in the
tank. He did revive; and the truncated ends of the
ray-stumps enabled me to see the arrangement of the
spines. These form about nine rows on each side,
radiating fan-like; within the undermost row on each
side is a row of flexible bladdery tubes much like the
suckers, and like them protruding from orifices in the
calcareous skeleton, but not retractile. They are studded
with tiny warts, and terminate not in a sucking disk,
but in a sort of bifid extremity. They are not used for
locomotion, nor are they ordinarily applied to the ground
as if tactile, and yet are continually thrown round so
that the tip is brought up to the base, and this suddenly
and abruptly, and every few seconds, as if something
were captured and conveyed to the mouth; but this
cannot be, for the mouth is not there, and nothing is
seen to be seized. Perhaps some intelligence, in a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
unimaginable by us, is thus obtained, of outward
things.</p>

<p>The poor maimed creature managed to stump awkwardly
about for a few days, but soon died, with no perceptible
attempt to renew the self-amputated members.</p>

<p>The Brittle-stars appear to move by means of the
flexibility of their long snake-like rays, the spines with
which they are furnished enabling these organs to obtain
a hold on the surface along which they crawl; and that
so secure that even perpendicular and very smooth
surfaces present no hindrance to their progression.
They have no proper suckers; and the rays are not
constituent portions of the body, containing part of the
stomach and intestine as in the true Star-fishes, but
imperforate appendages to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANGLED CRAB.</div>

<p>Crouching among the rubbish, with all its long limbs
snugly packed together, as if hoping to find safety in
being overlooked, we see a strange form of crustacea,
the Angled Crab.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Vain hope! How can a creature of
that bizarre form, and of those conspicuous colours, be
concealed from notice by merely lying still? Gently
touch him behind, and what an enormous length of
limb is suddenly thrown out! If, according to the proverb,
“kings have long arms,” surely this must be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
very monarch of the crabs; and most curiously are they
folded when at rest, the fore-arm lying close, throughout
its length, upon the upper arm, the elbow projecting
far on each side. The carapace is sometimes described
as rhomboidal, but this does not give us a correct idea
of its form; its outline is rather that of an isosceles
triangle, of which the apical half is cut off; the base of
this truncate triangle, which is the front side of the shell,
runs off into two sharp spines at the angles, and has
also a broad projection in the middle, on each side of
which are seated the long footstalks of the eyes, and
which carries on its front the two pairs of antennæ.
The thighs of the true legs are thin and blade-like, so
that these limbs all pack one over the other very
compactly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="PLATE26"></a>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>The general colour is a light salmon-red, often with
the hinder half of the carapace, and the inner sides of
the limbs, of a pale buff. The eyes (not the stalks) and
the movable finger of each hand, which is slender and
elegantly curved, are polished black.</p>

<p>Not uncommon with us, it is not very often seen even
by the naturalist, as it seems to be properly an inhabitant
of deep water. Occasionally it is washed ashore
on the beach by a heavy sea; but this is accidental.
Montagu first ascertained it to be British by finding it
at Kingsbridge, near Plymouth. Mr. Couch finds it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
common on the Cornwall coast, together with an allied,
but certainly distinct, species, the <i>G. rhomboides</i> of the
Mediterranean, to be identified by its lacking a second
spine behind each angular one, which is well marked in
our species. Though essentially a southern form, it
occurs on the Dublin coast, and that in sufficient number
to have obtained a popular appellation,&mdash;that of
“Coffin-crab;” the term “coffin” being possibly a word
of the Irish tongue, meaning something very different
from that which it suggests to our ears.</p>

<p>Cranch records, as a curious habit of the species, that
“they live in excavations formed in the hardened mud,
and that their habitations, at the extremities of which
they live, are open at both ends.” This description
implies a habitat above low water, if not above tide-marks;
for where else could “hardened mud” be found?
or if it were found in the deep water, how could it come
under the observer’s cognizance? However, I know
that many marine creatures are littoral in some localities,
which are exclusively deep-water subjects in
others.</p>

<p>Several observant naturalists have noticed the frequency
with which the species is obtained from the
stomachs of the larger ground-feeding fishes,&mdash;the cod
especially. Mr. Ball has taken four at a time from a
single cod in Youghal shambles. This is a well-known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
source for procuring rare specimens of the inhabitants
of the deep, particularly Crustacea and the shelled
Mollusca; for the fishes are expert and persevering
and successful collectors of natural history, and are
continually picking up objects for which the naturalist
would almost give one of his eyes. Mr. Gordon of
Elgin, some years ago, gave a long list of Crustacea,
many of them of great rarity, which he had procured
from stomachs of cod-fish, “through the agency of
Widow Scott and her son John, of the fishing village
of Stotfield,” on the Moray Firth. His remarks are
suggestive, not only to those residing on the coast, but
to the denizens of inland towns. “By a small douceur
to the fisherman’s family, and by the assistance of the
fish-curer on the coast, the fishmonger of the large
town, or of some acquaintance in the fishing village,
it is believed that almost any number of these now
useless receptacles [viz., cod-stomachs], could be obtained.
It may excite at first a little nausea to open
up and examine these omnivorous reservoirs, but this
will soon pass off; and were it of longer continuance
than it is, the stores to be unfolded would amply compensate
for all the disagreeable feeling that may for a
time arise. It is not only the crustacean that is thus
gathered from the inaccessible depths of the ocean, but
often the rare shell, with its still rarer inhabitant. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
radiated animal and the curious zoophyte will also be
found congregated together there; all of them, no
doubt, at times mutilated or partly digested, but not
unfrequently fresh and complete, as if newly past the
voracious jaws.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUT-CRAB.</div>

<p>Two or three specimens of another curious crab are
also in our haul. Unlike the <i>Gonoplax</i>, the little Nut-crab<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
is not by any means conspicuous in a chaotic heap
like this; it requires a sharp eye, and one familiar with
the form, to discern him. Remarkably sluggish, he remains
motionless; his tiny limbs are almost concealed
under the edges of his shell; his body is destitute of
sharp angles; its colour is a dull white: in fact the
eye might roam over it a dozen times without supposing
it anything more than an irregular rubbed quartz
pebble.</p>

<p>Yet when you pick it up, it is a pretty little Crab.
The form of the body is unlike that of any other of our
genera; indeed the type of which it is a representative,
though largely developed in the tropical and sub-tropical
seas, scarcely reaches to our shores. Some of the
allied species in the hotter parts of the globe, are very
curious, such as the <i>Calappa</i>, a crab in which the very
short limbs are so closely packed to the body, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
wholly concealed by the smooth and rounded shell, that
the curious sailor often picks it up and pockets it, as a
pretty white stone, little suspecting that he has a living
Crab in his fob. And there it lies for hours, perhaps, till
he pulls out his supposed pebble, which has not ventured
all the while to attempt to crawl.</p>

<p>I believe almost all we yet know of the habits of the
timid little Nut-crabs is derived from the portrait that
I drew of one of them<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> some years ago, from specimens
that I obtained at Weymouth. Since then I have repeatedly
kept it in captivity for long periods at a time,
and indeed I have one or two now. Yet I have little
to add to the sketch I then drew of its manners. It
is inert, folding its tiny legs on itself when touched,
and remaining motionless for some time. It buries
itself in the gravel, descending backwards: this is a
somewhat slow process, suited to its usual phlegmatic
habit. It brings its hindmost pairs of feet on each side
together; then thrusting down their united points, opens
and expands them, forcing apart the gravel; at the same
moment the posterior part of the body is brought down
into the hollow thus made, and the action of the feet is
repeated. The process is continued until the hinder
parts are covered and the muzzle alone is visible, with
the two claws. Thus it sits quite still, reminding one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of a toad, the broad triangular pedipalps that fit so close
occasionally opening, like the folding-doors of a tiny
cabinet, and allowing the palpi to be thrust out to wipe
the minute eyes. The face, when examined with a lens
through the glass walls of the aquarium, has a most
funny expression, being singularly like that of an ancient
man.</p>

<p>Like many marine animals, <i>Ebalia</i> uses the hours of
the night as its chief season of activity. As long as
the candles are in the room, it remains pretty still, but
as soon as darkness reigns, it sets out on its travels.
Not indeed with the railway pace of some of its fellows
does our little ancient travel; he is but a “slow
coach;” but he gropes about among the pebbles, and
is usually found the next morning, buried at some distance
from the point where the previous evening had
left him.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BRYER’S NUT-CRAB.</div>

<p>The little specimens before us appear to belong to
<i>Ebalia Bryerii</i>. It is porcellaneous white, tinged with
pale scarlet. The little feet are painted scarlet on a
white ground, especially the swollen-jointed claws,
which are very gay, and under a lens show a marbled
pattern of rich scarlet. This little Crab has an unique
appearance, very attractive. Its motions are quick and
sudden, mostly lateral, when alarmed; but it is habi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>tually
sluggish. Sometimes it appears to sham death;
for if pushed, it at first tries to escape by running; but
if the annoyance continues, it stiffens its limbs, and
allows itself to be pushed without resistance; and when
laid on its back in the water, will lie motionless for a
minute or more, then suddenly turn over and crawl
away.</p>

<p>Hosts of other things we capture in this summary
sweeping of the sea-bottom, and by the time we have
drifted down towards the Orestone, till we are close
enough to make out the noble leaves of the tree-mallows
that grow out of its rocky heights, we have
accumulated a marvellous store,&mdash;almost enough, indeed,
to set up a little provincial museum. Brittle-stars
and urchins; cucumbers great and small; bivalve
and univalve mollusks; swollen ascidians, smooth and
warty; active, shuffling, sucking fishes; heaps of mossy
<i>Bryozoa</i>; long bristling tufts of Hydroid zoophytes;
naked worms, twining and writhing amidst the mass,
gleaming in purple and pearl; sea-mice “armed in
gold,” like Virgil’s Orion; tangled masses of Serpula-pipes,
every one with its scarlet-crowned tenant; these,
and multitudes of creatures besides, come up from the
teeming sea-floor, and all at once claim our bewildered
attention. And there is not one of the host that is not
worthy of it; not one that would not be an eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
witness of its Creator’s glory; but we must for the
present neglect them all (not without hope of another
meeting with some of them at least), in order to
devote a few moments to one group of remarkable
interest.</p>

<p>It is that unaccountable association of diverse and
unrelated creatures, which, if we had not repeatedly seen
it, we should not believe; the companionship of the
Hermit-crab with the beautiful Cloak-anemone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERMIT-CRAB AND CLOAKLET.</div>

<p>Every one is familiar with that impudent and intrusive
species of Hermit-crab,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> which, with its foxy-brown
head and legs protruding, rolls over shells and
pebbles with rattling patter, on almost every beach.
The species I speak of is quite distinct from that homely
and amusing subject. Though attaining a size fully
equal, its proportions are much slenderer and more elegant;
and the colours,&mdash;a light fawn, set off with soft
tints of azure, lilac, and scarlet,&mdash;are far more beautiful
than those of its fellow; not to speak of technical characters
which abundantly distinguish the two.</p>

<p>The companion of the Cloaklet, which bears the name
of Mr. Prideaux of Plymouth, who first made it known,
is exclusively a deep-water species. Found on various
parts of our coast, it invariably occurs in this associa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>tion.
I believe the Crab in no instance lives without
the Anemone, the Anemone in no instance without the
Crab. Examples, indeed, do now and then occur, as
mentioned by Forbes, in which the one comes up in
the dredge without the other; but I believe this is
only when the rude action of the dredge has frightened
the Crab, and induced it suddenly to vacate the shell
and desert its friend. The Bernard is never attended
by any such companion.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The history of the tenancy of univalve shells by these
curious Crabs is well known; and the comic scenes
that take place in the process of flitting from one tenement
to another, larger and more commodious, have been
so fully narrated by myself and other observers, that I
shall assume the reader to be conversant with them.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
And the rather because the association of the Crab with
the Zoophyte is a thing so much more singular, so much
more unaccountable, and so much less generally known,
that I shall seek to tell the story in some detail.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">HERMIT AND CLOAKLET.</div>

<p>To premise:&mdash;the Cloaklet is an anemone of the
<i>Sagartia</i> family, beautiful in its colours and remarkable
in its form. It is generally reddish-brown on the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
(lower) part of its body, which hue melts into snowy
white on the upper parts; the whole studded with
rosy-purple spots, and surmounted by a marginal line
of pale scarlet. The tentacles and disk are pure white.
It attains a rather large size, and has the peculiarity
of being not round in its basal outline like other Anemones,
but oblong, the base expanding in two lateral
directions. It always selects the inner lip of an univalve
shell for its place of adhesion, and the two
lateral ends of its base gradually extend around the
mouth of the shell till they meet on its outer edge,
and unite with a suture: thus the outline of the
animal forms a ring.</p>

<p>It had often been an interesting speculation with me,
in what manner the due relation of size is maintained
between the <i>Adamsia</i> and the shell, in the progressive
growth of the former. There is a manifest proportion
between the two, the young Cloaklet occupying a small
shell, such as that of a <i>Littorina</i> or <i>Trochus</i>; the full-grown
individual a large one, such as that of a <i>Natica</i>
or <i>Buccinum</i>. The Crab is able to shift from a smaller
to a larger shell when he needs enlarged accommodation;
and since we know that his congener, <i>P. Bernhardus</i>,
does this habitually, we naturally conclude that
such is the habit of <i>P. Prideauxii</i>. Presuming then
that this is the case, what becomes of the <i>Adamsia</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
If the Crab shifts his quarters and leaves the <i>Adamsia</i>
behind, the association is broken, and we should constantly
find <i>Paguri</i> without <i>Adamsiæ</i>, and <i>Adamsiæ</i>
without <i>Paguri</i>. But we find neither the one nor
the other.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if <i>Adamsia</i> is able to shift its
quarters also, how does it proceed in its search for a
new shell? If it forsakes the old tenement at the
same time as the Crab, and together with it takes
possession of the new one, by what means is unity of
will and action secured? What communication of
thought takes place from the one to the other? As the
<i>Adamsia</i> does not adhere to the Crab, but to the shell,
that is, as they are independent of each other’s movements,
who takes the initiative? Who goes to seek
the lodging? And at what point of the transaction
does the other come in? All these questions I had
mused upon with interest; and at length received some
light towards their solution.</p>

<p>On the 10th of January, 1859, I obtained, by dredging,
in Torbay, a specimen of <i>Adamsia palliata</i>, about half-grown,
on a rather small shell of <i>Natica monilifera</i>,
tenanted by a <i>Pagurus Prideauxii</i>, which seemed
already too big for his habitation. Having put them
into a well-established tank of large dimensions, the
contents of which were in excellent condition, I suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>ceeded
in doing what I had never done before, domiciliating
both Crab and <i>Adamsia</i>. Both continued in the
highest health, and became quite at home.</p>

<p>After about three months, however, I noticed that
the <i>Adamsia</i> was not looking so well. One side or
wing had gradually loosed its hold of the shell-lip, so
that it hung loosely down beneath the breast of the
Crab. Yet in other respects the zoophyte seemed healthy.
Latterly, too, the Crab had manifested symptoms of
uncomfortable straitness, in the great extrusion of his
fore-parts; so great, indeed, as to expose even the front
of the soft abdomen. Yet I felt reluctant to present to
the Crab a larger shell, fearing that he would, in availing
himself of it, desert his zoophyte friend, which would
then die, and I should lose the specimen.</p>

<p>At length the desire to solve a problem in science
prevailed over this feeling. A fact is better than a
specimen. And so (on April 21st) I selected from my
cabinet a full-grown <i>Natica</i> shell, and placed it on the
tank-floor, not far from the disconsolate trio.</p>

<p>The <i>Pagurus</i> presently found the new shell, and
immediately began to overhaul it. He did not do,
however, as his brother Bernhard would have done, at
once shift into the new house. Having turned it
mouth upward, he took hold of the outer and inner
lip, each with a claw, and began to drag it about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
tank. Occasionally he relinquished the hold of one
claw, and probed the interior in the usual manner, and
then resumed his march. I watched the proceedings
for an hour or more, when, having other work to do, I
left him alone.</p>

<p>The thought did occur to me&mdash;Can this delay be
intended to make the <i>Adamsia</i> cognizant of what is in
contemplation, and to prepare it for the change? But
I dismissed it as unlikely.</p>

<p>After about an hour’s absence I returned to the
examination. The <i>Pagurus</i> was comfortably lodged in
his new abode, and the old one, which now looked small
indeed, lay deserted at some little distance. I eagerly
turned the latter over, to see what was the condition of
the <i>Adamsia</i>. Lo! no <i>Adamsia</i> was there; and the
<i>Pagurus</i>, presently approaching the front of the tank,
I saw, to my great gratification, that the old association
was unbroken. There was the <i>Adamsia</i>, with one
wing adhering to the lip of the new shell, and apparently
the opposite wing also; but, from the position of the
group, this I could not be quite certain of. The situation
of the zoophyte was quite normal,&mdash;the centre
immediately below the breast of the Crab, and in contact
with the inner lip of the shell, while that wing
which I could clearly see was creeping round upon the
outer lip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Examining now more closely the condition of things,
with a lens, I saw that the central part of the <i>Adamsia’s</i>
base was adherent by a small point of its surface to the
under side of the thorax of the Crab, between the bases
of the legs.</p>

<p>Now this adhesion to the Crab is a circumstance
which, so far as I know, never takes place in the ordinary
relations of the animals; and therefore I could
not but think it an extraordinary and temporary provision
for the removal of the <i>Adamsia</i> from the old to
the new shell, and for the correct adjustment of its
position on the latter.</p>

<p>How then can we avoid the conclusion, that, as soon
as the Crab had found the new shell to be suitable for
exchange, the <i>Adamsia</i> also was made cognizant of
the same fact; and that, during the two hours which
followed, the latter loosened its adhesion to the old
shell, and, laying hold of the bosom of its protector,
was by him carried to the new house, where immediately
it began to secure the like hold to that which it had
just relinquished?</p>

<p>Eleven days elapsed after the above observations
were made, when I obtained another interesting fact
bearing on this strange association. The <i>Adamsia</i> had
not looked well since the change of residence; its
adhesion to the shell had been but partial at the best,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
some days more, some days less, extensive; but for the
most part a considerable portion of the zoophyte was
hanging down from the shell. The Crab, on the other
hand, was evidently in clover, and showed no inclination
to go back to his old lodging.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May I found the <i>Adamsia</i> detached,
and lying helpless on the bottom of the tank, beneath
the Crab, who, when disturbed, walked off, leaving his
companion behind. I thought now it was a gone case,
and that it was all up with my elegant <i>protegée</i>.</p>

<p>An hour or two afterwards, however, how great was
my surprise to see the <i>Adamsia</i> fairly established again,
adhering to the shell by a good broad base, and looking
more healthy than I had seen her for many a day!
Strangely enough, she was adhering in a false position,
having taken hold on the outer lip of the shell, instead
of the inner, as usual. Here was a fresh proof of
intelligence somewhere; and I at once set myself to
find where.</p>

<p>Carefully taking up the shell with the aquarium-tongs,
and bringing it close to the surface, but not
out of water, I gently dislodged the <i>Adamsia</i> with
my fingers, and allowed it to fall prone upon the
bottom. I then released the shell with its tenant, and
drove the latter towards the spot where the zoophyte
lay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner did the Crab touch the <i>Adamsia</i> than he
took hold of it with his claws, first with one, then with
both, and I saw in an instant what he was going to do.
In the most orderly and expert manner he proceeded
to apply the <i>Adamsia</i> to the shell. He found it lying
base upward, and therefore the first thing was to turn
it quite round. With the alternate grasps of the two
pincer-claws, nipping up the flesh of the <i>Adamsia</i>
rudely enough, as it seemed, he got hold of it so that
he could press the base against the proper part of the
shell, the inner lip. Then he remained quite still,
holding it firmly pressed, for about ten minutes; at the
end of which time he cautiously drew away first one
claw, and then the other; and, beginning to walk away,
I had the pleasure to see that the <i>Adamsia</i> was once
more fairly adhering, and now in the right place.</p>

<p>Two days after the <i>Adamsia</i> was again lost. On
searching I discovered it lying in a crevice, whence I
plucked it, and laid it on the bottom. Here again the
Crab found it, and immediately went through the same
process as last described, and again made it adhere.
But I saw that the <i>Adamsia</i> was unhealthy, for it
seemed to have but enfeebled power of retaining its
hold. The manifestation of the mode in which the
instinctive actings of the two creatures occur is, however,
sufficiently clear. The Crab is certainly the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
active promoter of the partnership; it is abundantly
evident that he values the company of his elegant but
very heterogeneous associate. These last observations
compel the conclusion that the claws of the Crab are
always employed in the transference of the Cloaklet
from shell to shell.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROOFS OF INTELLIGENCE.</div>

<p>But what a series of instincts does this series of facts
open to us! The knowledge by the Crab of the qualities
of the new shell; the delay of his own satisfaction
till his associate is ready; the power of communicating
the fact to her; the power in her of apprehending the
communication; her immediate obedience to the intimation;
her relinquishment of her wonted hold, which
for months at least had never been interrupted; her
simultaneous taking of a new, unwonted hold, where
alone it could have been of any use; the concerted
action of both; the removal; her relinquishment of the
transitory adhesion as soon as its purpose was accomplished;
her simultaneous grasp of the new shell in the
proper places; all these are wonderful to contemplate,
wonderful considered singly, far more wonderful in
their cumulation. Is there not here much more
than what our modern physiologists are prone to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
automatic movements, the results of reflex sensorial
action? The more I study the lower animals, the more
firmly am I persuaded of the existence in them of
psychical faculties, such as consciousness, intelligence,
will, and choice! and <i>that</i>, even in those forms in which
as yet no nervous centres have been detected.</p>

<h2>X.<br />

OCTOBER</h2>


<div class="sidenote">PORTUGUESE MAN-OF-WAR.</div>

<p>The naturalist who has occasion to make a voyage
over the warmer regions of the ocean, is continually
delighted by the sight of numberless forms of animals,
principally of the lower invertebrate classes, which
either habitually swim at the surface of the sea, or
come thither at intervals to enjoy the stimulus of the
atmospheric air. Many of these are exceedingly curious
and interesting; many totally unlike any forms that
occur on the shores of temperate countries; many elegant
in contour, and adorned with brilliant colours.
Perhaps there is scarcely any that takes a stronger hold
on the fancy, certainly none is more familiar, than a
little thing that he daily marks floating in the sunlit
waves, as the ship glides swiftly by, which the sailors
tell him is the Portuguese man-of-war.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Perhaps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
dead calm has settled over the sea; and the observer,
as he leans over the bulwarks of the ship, has opportunities
of scrutinizing the ocean-rover at leisure, as it
lazily rises and falls on the long sluggish heavings of
the glassy surface. Then he sees that the comparison
of the stranger to a ship is a felicitous one; for, at a
little distance it might well be mistaken for a child’s
mimic ship, shining in all the gaudy painting in which
it came out of the toy-shop; and he is ready to pity
the forlorn urchin in tunic and knickerbockers, whose
cherished boat has broken her moorings of thread, and
drifted with winds and tides far, far out of reach of land.</p>

PORTUGUESE MAN-OF-WAR.   TONGUED SARSIA.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>Not unfrequently does one of the tiny vessels come
so close alongside that, by means of the ship’s bucket,
with a little assistance from a smart fellow, who has
jumped into the “chains” with a boat-hook, it is captured,
and brought on deck to be subjected to scientific
examination. A dozen voices are however lifted, warning
you by no means to touch it, for well the experienced
seaman knows its terrific powers of defence. It
does not now appear so like a ship as when it was at a
distance. It is an oblong bladder of tough membrane,
varying considerably in shape (and hence no two original
figures agree in this respect), and also in size, from less
than an inch in length to the size of a man’s hat. Once
in a voyage to Mobile, when rounding the Florida Reef,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
I was nearly a whole day passing through a fleet of
these little Portuguese men-of-war, which studded the
smooth sea as far as the eye could reach, and must have
extended for many miles. These were of all sizes within
the limits I have mentioned. Generally, there is a
conspicuous difference between the two extremities of
the bladder, one end being rounded, while the other is
more pointed, or is terminated by a small knob-like
swelling, or beak-shaped excrescence, where there is a
minute orifice. Sometimes, however, no such excrescence
is visible, and the orifice cannot be detected.</p>

<p>The bladder is filled with air, and therefore floats
almost wholly on the surface. Along the upper side,
nearly from end to end, runs a thin ridge of membrane,
which is capable of being erected at the will of the
animal to a considerable height, fully equal at times to
the entire width of the bladder, when it represents an
arched fore-and-aft sail, the bladder being the hull.
From the bottom of the bladder, near the thickest extremity,
where there is a denser portion of the membrane,
depends a crowded mass of organs, most of which take
the form of very slender, highly contractile, and moveable
threads, which hang down into the deep to a depth
of many feet, or even occasionally, of several yards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BLADDER.</div>

<p>The colours of this curious creature are very vivid:
the bladder, though in some parts transparent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
colourless, and in some specimens almost entirely so,
is in general painted with the richest blues and purples,
mingled with green and crimson to some less extent;
these all being, not as sometimes described, iridescent
or changeable reflections, but positive colours, independent
of the incidence of light, and, for the most part
possessing great depth and fulness. The sail-like erectile
membrane is transparent, tinted towards the edge with
a lovely rose-pink hue, the colours arranged in a peculiar
fringe-like manner.</p>

<p>When examined anatomically, the bladder is found
to be composed of two walls of membrane, which are
lined with cilia, and have between them the nutritive
fluid which supplies the place of blood. Besides this,
the double membrane is turned in, somewhat as the
foot of a stocking is inverted, when ready for putting
on; and thus there is a bladder within a bladder, both
having double walls. The inner (<i>pneumatocyst</i>) is
much smaller than the outer (<i>pneumatophore</i>); and
the point where it is turned in is contracted to the
almost imperceptible orifice that has been mentioned.
The inner bladder sends up closed tubular folds into
the crest, which, being invested by the membranous
walls of the outer sac, give to the sail that appearance
of vertical wrinkles which is conspicuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF POISON.</div>

<p>Most formidable are the powers which reside in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
long tentacles. Each of these is an excessively slender
ribbon of contractile substance, connected at its base
with a translucent bag, and carrying at short intervals
throughout its length semi-rings of thread-cells (<i>cnidæ</i>),
similar to those of our Sea-anemones, but of far more
deadly virulence. Mr. Bennett, who, for the sake
of science, ventured to test their powers, has left us a
terrific account of his sufferings. “On one occasion,”
he says, “I tried the experiment of its stinging powers
upon myself, intentionally; when, on seizing it by the
bladder portion, it raised the long cables by muscular
contraction of the bands situated at the base of the
feelers, and, entwining the slender appendages about
my hand and finger, inflicted severe and peculiarly
pungent pain, adhering most tenaciously at the same
time, so as to be extremely difficult of removal. The
stinging continued during the whole time that the
minutest portion of the tentacula remained adherent to
the skin. I soon found that the effects were not merely
confined to the acute pungency inflicted, but produced
a great degree of constitutional irritation: the pain extended
upwards along the arm, increasing not only in
extent but in severity, apparently acting along the
course of the absorbents, and could only be compared
to a severe rheumatic attack; the pulse was accelerated,
and a feverish state of the whole system was produced;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
the muscles of the chest even were affected, the same
distressing pain felt on taking a full respiration as obtains
in a case of acute rheumatism. The secondary
effects were very severe, continuing for nearly three-quarters
of an hour; the duration of the pain being
probably longer, in consequence of the time and delay
occasioned by removing the exciting and virulent tentacula
from the skin, as they adhered to it, by the aid
of the stinging capsules, with an annoying degree of
tenacity. On the whole being removed, the pain began
gradually to abate; but during the day a peculiar numbness
was felt, accompanied also by an increased temperature
in the limb upon which the stings had been
inflicted. For some hours afterwards the skin displayed
white elevations or wheals on the parts stung, similar
to those usually seen resulting from the poison of the
stinging-nettle. The intensity of the pain depends in
some degree upon the size and consequent power of the
creature; and after it has been removed from the water
for some time, the stinging property, although still continuing
to act, is found to have perceptibly diminished.
To remove the irritation, at first cold water was applied,
but this, instead of alleviating, increased the
evil: an application of vinegar relieved the unpleasant
symptoms, and olive oil has produced a similar beneficial
effect. I have observed that this irritative power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
is retained for some weeks after the death of the animal
in the vesicles of the cables; and even linen cloth which
had been used for wiping off the adhering tentacles,
when touched, still retained the pungency, although it
had lost the power of producing such violent constitutional
irritation.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Among the tentacles there are seen many depending
organs, which take somewhat the shape of a claret-bottle,
with the mouth a little expanded. These are
highly moveable, turning and bending themselves in
various directions. They are termed <i>polypites</i>, and are
the mouths and stomachs of the animal: taking-in and
digesting food, much as the protrusile lips of an Anemone
do. Mr. Bennett describes the <i>Physalia</i> as seizing and
benumbing small fishes by means of the tentacles, which
are alternately contracted to half-an-inch, and then shot
out with amazing velocity to a length of several feet,
and which drag the helpless and entangled prey to the
sucker-like mouths, the stomach-cavities of which were
filled while he looked-on, with atoms of the flesh
absorbed.</p>

<p>Dr. Wallich thinks Mr. Bennett must have mistaken
what he saw; because he has observed that in a great
number of cases the <i>Physalia</i> is accompanied by small
fishes, which play around and among the depending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
tentacles without molestation. He has in so many
cases seen this, and even witnessed the actual contact
of the fishes with the tentacles, with no inconvenience
to the former, that he too hastily concludes that “the
urticating organs are innocuous.” Surely the premises
by no means warrant such an inference. There is no
antagonism between the two series of facts witnessed
by such excellent observers; the venomous virulence
of these organs has been abundantly proved by many
naturalists, myself among the number, and Mr. Bennett,
to his cost, as narrated above. We have only to suppose
that the injection of the poison is under the control of
the <i>Physalia’s</i> will, and the impunity of the bold little
fishes is sufficiently accounted for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GULF-STREAM.</div>

<p>That wonderful river that flows with a well-defined
course through the midst of the Atlantic,&mdash;the Gulf-stream,&mdash;brings
on its warm waters many of the denizens
of the tropical seas, and wafts them to the shores
on which its waves impinge. Hence it is that so many
of the proper pelagic creatures are from time to time
observed on the coasts of Cornwall and Devon. The
Portuguese man-of-war is among them, sometimes
paying its visits in fleets; more commonly in single
stranded hulks. Scarcely a season passes without one
or more of these lovely strangers occurring in the
vicinity of Torquay; and from one of these I took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
opportunity of making the careful drawing with which
I illustrate this paper.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The fishermen and similar
persons who pick them up, always endeavour to make
a harvest of their captures, not by the sale, but by the
exhibition of them, sometimes carrying the specimen
from door to door, sometimes erecting a temporary
screen in some place of resort, exaggerating the rarity
and value of the specimen outrageously. This summer
(1862) I have known of three in this vicinity; and
have heard of one at the Isle of Wight, in July, which
forms the subject of a memoir and a coloured figure by
Mr. Humphreys in the <i>Intellectual Observer</i>; also, a
fleet of hundreds scattered over both sides of the same
island in August, as recorded by Mr. Rogers in the
<i>Zoologist</i>; and finally, one at Tenby in July, obtained
by Mr. Hughes, and recorded in the last-named periodical.</p>

<p>Mr. Hughes in his account mentioned a circumstance
as normal, which, being unknown to me, excited my curiosity.
His specimen was accompanied by “its attendant
satellites, two <i>Velellæ</i>.” In reply to my inquiries my
friend gives me the following information:&mdash;“My
authority for the association of Velella with Physalia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
is Jenkins, the collector at Tenby, who was attending
me when they were found.</p>

<p>“The Physalia was taken by me first; and, while I
was admiring it, I noticed that Jenkins continued searching
for something. Immediately afterwards he came up
with the Velella in his hand, at the same time stating
they were generally found with the Portuguese man-of-war.
As I had found the man very honest and truthful
in his dealings with me (and not previously being
familiar with either of the creatures), I accepted the
information as correct.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">VELELLA.</div>

<p>The <i>Velella</i> is a creature closely allied to the <i>Physalia</i>,
having the same essential structure, but differing greatly
in form and appearance. It consists of a flat disk of
thin cartilaginous shell, of a long rectangular outline,
on which stands erect another similar plate somewhat
triangular, extending across from corner to corner.
One large polypite or mouth hangs down from the centre
of the under side, and short tentacles project on all
sides from the edges of the horizontal plate. The
internal structure is very complex. The whole is
enclosed in a thin layer of flesh, which is tinged of a
fine blue colour, sometimes varied with purple and
green. It is generally about two inches long, and the
erect plate rather less in height. As the little creature
floats on the waves, this plate forms a sail, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
breeze playing upon it, imparts to the whole animal,
according to Mr. Bennett, a rotatory motion.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">STEPHANOMIA.</div>

<p>Both these oceanic forms of the class <i>Hydrozoa</i> agree
in being quite unprovided with any apparatus for locomotion.
Though their parts can be moved among
themselves, and sometimes with much vigour, as we
have seen in the case of the tentacles of the <i>Physalia</i>,
yet the whole organism would be absolutely confined
for life to one spot, were the elements motionless around
it: it is merely passively driven hither and thither by
the winds and waves. But there are other members of
the class, and even some belonging to the same order,
which have express organs of locomotion. A most exquisite
example is found in <i>Stephanomia</i>, of which a
specimen was taken in Kingstown harbour in July 1856,
by Mr. Joseph Greene, and described and figured in
the “Proceedings of the Dublin University Zoological
Association” for that year. The float (<i>pneumatocyst</i>)
is a small bladder, which is filled with air, and which
has the appearance, when alive, of a globule of quicksilver;
while the slight inequalities of its surface reflect
the light in such a manner that it often looks as if a
fine network of crimson veins ramified over its surface.
From the end of this oval bladder a long fleshy tube<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
hangs down in the water to the distance of six or seven
inches, the upper part of which is surrounded by a
number&mdash;seven to ten&mdash;of little clear transparent bells,
looking very much like the blossoms of our common
Arbutus, and crowded, like flowers with short footstalks,
on the stem. These swimming bells (<i>nectocalyces</i>) are
true organs of locomotion; for by their contraction they
drive out the water contained in their cavities, and by
their combined impulse, all acting together, shoot the
whole creature forward. This action I will explain
more in detail presently.</p>

<p>The long tube or common stem is very irritable, and
under stimulus is coiled up in a spiral, then gradually
relaxed, and allowed to hang loosely down. Attached
to it throughout are the <i>polypites</i>, or stomach-mouths,
protected by leaf-like organs, which overlap them.
Numerous tentacles, too, of exceeding length and tenuity,
and throwing off branches, spring from the stem
throughout its length, all the extremities of each forming
tiny oval knobs of spiral coils, the whole capable of
being thrown into the most beautiful and graceful convolutions,
now bent at right angles, and again thrown
out in a series of light airy-looking arches.</p>

<p>The exquisitely beautiful specimen described was
taken in sultry weather, when the sea was perfectly
calm. “It lived in a large globe of sea-water for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
days, and was a most striking and beautiful object: it
generally lay quite upright in the water, the slightest
ripple upon the surface of which set it in motion; and
immediately coiling up its fishing lines, and shortening
the length of its stolon by about one-third, it threw its
set of little balloons into strong pulsations, until, weary
of descending, it submitted to be guided by its brightly
glittering head, and soon ascended to the surface. When
subjected to examination it soon died, and was not long
until it had completely broken itself up.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SARSIA.</div>

<p>The <i>nectocalyx</i> or swimming-bell is, however, seen in
a much more developed condition in the delicate forms
which swarm in our harbours and about our rocky
coasts in summer and early autumn, and are known by
the name of Naked-eyed Medusæ. A common and
very characteristic example of this order is the Tongued
Sarsia,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> in which a single swimming-bell forms the
greatest portion of the whole creature. It is a tall
dome of crystalline colourless flesh, thick at the summit
and thinning off at the edges; about half an inch in
height. From the interior of this dome hangs the single
polypite, exactly as the clapper hangs from the top of
a bell. It is long and cylindrical, abruptly attenuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
at the upper part into a sort of foot-stalk, and at the
extremity enlarging into four fleshy, very protrusile,
lips, capable of seizing and sucking in an object much
larger than the diameter of the whole polypite. I have
seen a Sarsia, in confinement in a tank, lay hold of,
and swallow, a newly-hatched fish, notwithstanding the
activity of the latter. For hours afterwards the little
green-eyed fry was visible, the engulphment being a
very slow process; the Medusa, however, never let go
its hold; and gradually the tiny fish was sucked into the
interior, and passed up the cavity of the polypite, becoming
more and more cloudy and indistinct, as digestion
in the stomach gradually dissolved its tissues.</p>

<p>These little creatures are endowed with very effective
powers of locomotion. In the unbounded freedom of
their native sea, and in the limited dimensions of a glass
vase, they are alike sprightly. By rapid pump-like
contractions of their <i>nectocalyx</i>, they dart through the
water, and shoot round and round, almost with the
force and swiftness of a swimming fish. The summit
of the bell always goes foremost, whether the direction
of the movement be vertical, horizontal, or, as is most
commonly the case, oblique; and the tentacles, and
the long white polypite, drag behind in trailing lines.
Now and anon, the shooting is suddenly suspended, the
bell hangs over and remains awhile motionless, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
tentacles are allowed to depend like spiders’ webs, or
are suddenly drawn up into shrivelled puckers, become
mutually entangled and intertwisted, then slowly free
themselves, and hang down again. Sometimes the
motionless bell itself sinks very gradually, and the
tentacle-threads take the most elegant curves and arches
in their descent.</p>

<p>The manner in which the strong pulsating movements
of the Medusæ are performed depends on the
position and action of certain bands of muscular tissue.
Four of these radiate from the centre of the dome to
the margin. This course is not a straight but a curved
one. When, therefore, these bands are simultaneously
and forcibly contracted in length, they are drawn from
a curved into a straight line, and the cavity, which was
bell-shaped, becomes more conical, and its capacity is
considerably diminished; a portion of the water which
it before held is therefore driven out at the mouth, and
by its reaction forces the animal forward with a jerk
in the opposite direction. Besides these radiating
muscles, there are circular bands which pass round
the margin and the interior walls of the dome. These
by their contraction diminish the volume of the cavity,
and aid the action described above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORBES’S ÆQUOREA.</div>

<p>The tiny Sarsia has but four tentacles, which spring
from as many equidistant points on the margin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
bell. But in the genus <i>Æquorea</i>, of the same family,
these organs are far more numerous, two species which
I first discovered at Ilfracombe having, the one thirty-six,
the other about two hundred tentacles. The former
of these, which I have honoured with the name of the
late Edward Forbes,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> differs much in general appearance
from the little Sarsia, being a cake-shaped segment of
a globe, about three or four inches in diameter, and an
inch and a half in thickness. The roof of the interior
is low and nearly flat, or indeed dropping slightly in
the centre.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a id="PLATE29"></a>

</p></div>
</div>

<p>The polypite is peculiar, and would scarcely be recognised
as of the same nature with the lively bottle-shaped
organs of the Portuguese man-of-war, or the
long nimble tongue of the Sarsia. It forms a very
wide circle on the flat roof of the bell, whence the four
large triangular lips descend, which are cut into a
minutely divided fringe of filaments, that wave loosely
in the water. There are about seventy slender vessels
which radiate from the polypite circle along the roof to
the margin, where they join the circular marginal vessel.
I have said that the tentacles are about thirty-six in
all; that is, about half as many as the radiating
vessels, though the relation of number is not exact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
They hang down in the usual form, to the unassisted
eye appearing as excessively slender whitish or flesh-coloured
threads, capable of great elongation, or of contraction
into ovate spiral masses, hardly perceptible.
But by the aid of the microscope we discern that each
tentacle consists of a lengthened fleshy tube, on which
are set at pretty regular intervals thickened semi-rings,
or knobs, very much like the knobs on the horns of an
antelope in appearance. They do not quite encircle
the tentacle, and thus one side for the entire length is
smooth and straight. These thickened swellings are
collections of thread-capsules (<i>cnidæ</i>), which are packed
as close as they can lie in them, and give to the tentacle
that power of adhering by a touch to any animal whose
tissues are penetrable, and of benumbing and destroying
its vitality, in the manner which I have already, on more
than one occasion, alluded to.</p>

<p>I have not yet described the colours of this <i>Æquorea</i>;
they are, however, exceedingly lovely and beautiful.
The crystalline translucency of most of these Medusæ,
when they are colourless, and of the colourless parts of
such as have bright hues, is exquisite in its glass-like
purity; in this example the whole of the peripheral
portion of the dome is of this hyaline character; but
the lower part, which lies just above the flattened roof,
is of a lively azure blue, seen to great perfection, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
the animal is relieved by a dark background: the colour
is gradually lost at about a quarter of an inch from its
bottom. Then the radiating vessels are of a bright
rose-colour, drawn in lines along the colourless surface
of the roof; and the marginal vessel is of the same hue,
as are also the four triangular lips of the polypite, with
their ciliary fringes. These, as they depend, often extending
below the level of the margin, waved about in
various directions by the motion of the sea, or by the
animal’s own movements, add greatly to its elegance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LUMINOSITY.</div>

<p>That strange and at times magnificent and imposing
phenomenon, the luminosity of the sea, is certainly due
in part to some of the Medusæ. Members of perhaps
all the classes of marine invertebrate animals are at one
time or other engaged in the illumination, and no doubt
the most wide-spread production of spontaneous light,
and the most effective, is due to creatures which are
individually unrecognisable by the eye. When the ship
ploughing through the tropical sea, turns luminous
furrows on each side of her prow, and leaves a long
wake of curdling light astern, or when the steamer
dashes the water of our own estuaries into cascades
of fire and showers of coruscating sparks, it is doubtless
to the microscopic <i>Infusoria</i>, <i>Annelida</i>, and <i>Entomostraca</i>,
that we are mainly indebted for the charming
spectacle. Still, many of the Medusæ are conspicuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
luminous under certain conditions, generally displaying
the phenomenon at the moment of irritation; the light
being evolved, not apparently by any proper organs,
but either by the whole of the marginal ring, or by the
(often coloured) swellings that are seated at the base of
the tentacles.</p>

<p>The following appearances proved the luminosity of
this beautiful <i>Æquorea</i>, on being subjected to experiments
in the dark. When with my finger-nail I tapped
the glass jar in which two specimens were floating at
the surface, instantly each became brilliantly visible
as a narrow ring of light, the whole marginal canal
becoming luminous. On my touching them with the
end of a stick, the light became more vivid, and round
spots appeared here and there in the ring, of intense
lustre and of a greenish-blue tint. These were, I doubt
not, the tentacle-bulbs; and any one of them would be
excited to this intensity by my touching that part of
the margin with the stick. The luminosity of the ring
was not so evanescent as in some species, lasting several
seconds, and continuing to be renewed as often as I
molested the animal. The two circles of light, two
inches or more in diameter, were very beautiful as they
moved freely in the water, sinking or rising according
as they were touched, now seen in full rotundity, now
shrinking to an oval, or to a line, as either turned sidewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
to the eye, and reminded me of the <i>coronæ</i> of glory
in the pictures of the Italian school, round the heads of
saints.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CRIMSON-RINGED JELLY-FISH.</div>

<p>Most of the larger Medusæ of our coasts belong to
another order, including those which have covered eyes,
and some other peculiarities, chiefly connected with
reproduction. The <i>Lucernariæ</i>, which I have already
noticed, formerly associated with the Anemones, are
now united with this order. A very familiar example
we may see in our harbours and tidal rivers in summer,
the common Crimson-ringed Jelly-fish.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> It is a hemisphere
of colourless jelly, some six or eight inches in
diameter, which is usually well marked by four imperfect
rings of purplish crimson&mdash;the reproductive organs&mdash;seen
through the transparent flesh. The radiating
vessels are often tinged with the same colour.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">INFANT FORMS.</div>

<p>The most interesting circumstances in the history of
this large jelly-fish are the wonderfully varied phases
through which it passes in the earlier stages of its
existence. Along the margins of the lengthened flaps
of the polypite there are found remarkable pouches,
within which the ova are placed, and whence they are
hatched in the form of soft flat animalcules, capable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
swimming by means of cilia. This has been called a
<i>planula</i>. After swimming a while, it alters its form to
that of a pear, and presently adheres by its slender end
to a sea-weed or rock under water, hanging downward.
A depression now appears in the larger end, which
deepens and forms a mouth and stomach, and the little
<i>planula</i> has assumed a polype-form. Four tiny warts
now spring from the margin of the mouth, which
lengthen into tentacles; four more then shoot in the interspaces;
these eight increase to sixteen, then to thirty-two,
all at the same time acquiring great length. In
this stage, in which it is very common in our aquaria,
it has been supposed a new animal, and has been
named <i>Hydra tuba</i>. The space between the margin
and the mouth has widened into an “umbrella,” and
the mouth has protruded into a polypite. The whole
is of a translucent white hue, and the body without
the tentacles is ordinarily about one-sixth of an inch
high.</p>

<p>This stage sometimes lasts for years without further
change, except that creeping root-threads shoot from
the attached base, which send up at intervals buds that
grow into <i>Hydræ</i>; and buds break out from different
parts of the body itself, which likewise develop themselves,
the form in both cases being exactly similar to
that of the present <i>Hydra tuba</i>. Thus we frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
find numerous colonies of these tiny creatures crowded
together.</p>

<p>At length a change takes place. The body enlarges
both in length and thickness, and begins to show traces
of rings or segments, as if it had been tied tightly round
with threads at regular intervals. In this stage it has
been described under the name of <i>Scyphistoma</i>. These
cuts deepen, and the segments thus marked off become
hollow; and so they resemble a pile of tiny saucers set
one within another, each of which is now divided at its
rim into eight teeth. In this stage it has been once
more named, as if an independent animal, <i>Strobila</i>.</p>

<p>All this time the tentacles have been set around the
terminal margin, but now these are absorbed, and a new
set rapidly spring from the basal segment. The saucers
become very loosely attached; at length the end one
breaks away and swims through the sea, as a true Medusa,
though no more than a sixth of an inch wide,
pumping as it goes in proper parental wise. Others
quickly follow, and thus a colony of tiny swimming
jelly-fishes are shooting hither and thither in the liveliest
manner. Strange to say, these little Medusæ, which
as to details differ much from their adult form, have
been again described, under the name of <i>Ephydra</i>; all
these appellations indicating the assumptions of various
naturalists, who found the little creatures in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
respective stages, without knowing their previous
history, that each was an independent form of animal
life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CYDIPPE.</div>

<p>As the closer and more severe scrutiny of anatomical
structure has induced modern zoologists to separate the
Lucernaria from its formerly assigned alliance with the
Sea-anemones, and to associate it with the Medusæ, it
is interesting to remark that the scales of justice have
been maintained in equipoise by the like shifting of a
member from the Medusæ to the Anemones. The latter
animal is one familiar to most haunters of the shore,
and invariably admired as one of the most charming of
the many lovely forms that throng the summer seas;
it is the sweet little <i>Beröe</i>, or <i>Cydippe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Indeed at first
sight you would be little disposed to admit the propriety
of the transfer in this case, for certainly the active
glittering globule of pure crystal appears to possess
much more resemblance to one of the smaller Medusæ,
the <i>Sarsia</i>, for instance,&mdash;than to a daisy or a beadlet.
But naturalists look beneath the surface: and they find
that, with important peculiarities, the internal economy
of the <i>Cydippe</i>, and specially its digestive apparatus, are
modelled rather on the type of the latter than of the
former.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<p>We will not, however, trouble ourselves now with
these elaborate matters, but rather look at the exterior
and obvious characters of the charming little pet, which
is disporting itself in this vase of sea-water on our
table. It is a globe of pure colourless jelly, about as
big as a small marble, often having a little wart-like
swelling at one of its poles, where the mouth is placed.
At the other end there are minute orifices; and between
the two passes the stomach, of a form which is flat, or
wider in one diameter than in the other.</p>

<p>If the stomach be considered as the axis of the globe,
and the two extremities as its poles, the meridians of
longitude are well represented by eight narrow bands,
situated on the surface, which do not, however, reach
either pole. Along the course of each of these meridional
bands are fixed at close intervals minute square
moveable plates, whose outer edges are set with strong
cilia, like the teeth of a comb. These are the locomotive
organs, and most effective they are. They are used
like the paddles of a steamer, the little animal beating
the water with them in rapid and regular succession,
their minute subdivision causing the rays of light, especially
when in the sun, to play along these bands, with
the most brilliant prismatic colours; while their vigorous
strokes cause the globe to shoot hither and thither
through the water with remarkable power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Within the clear substance of the <i>Cydippe</i>, on each
side of the stomach, there is excavated a capacious
cavity, which communicates by a canal with the surface,
near the equator. Within each cavity is fixed a
tentacle of great length and slenderness, which the
animal can at pleasure shoot out of the orifice, and
allow to trail through the water, shortening, lengthening,
twisting, or coiling it at will; or, on the other hand,
quickly contract it into a tiny ball, and withdraw it
wholly within the proper cavity. A peculiarity, which
imparts an inexpressible charm to this apparatus, is, that,
throughout the length of this attenuate white thread,
short threadlets are given off at regular intervals, which
can be coiled or straightened, lengthened or shortened,
individually. They proceed only from one side of the
thread-like tentacle, though, from the slight twisting of
the axis, they seem now to project on one side, now on
another.</p>

<p>It has been well observed that of the grace and
beauty which the entire apparatus presents in the living
animal, or the marvellous ease and rapidity with which
it can be alternately contracted, extended, and bent at
an infinite variety of angles, no verbal description
can sufficiently treat. Fortunately this little beauty
is so common in summer and autumn on all our
coasts, that few who use the surface-net can possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
miss its capture. So lovely a creature is worthy of a
poet’s description: it has received it.</p>

<h2>XI.<br />

NOVEMBER</h2>


<p>If we could roam at pleasure over the bottom of the
sea, with the privilege of using all our senses as effectually
and as comfortably as in the air, we should
doubtless see some wonderful things. We might not,
indeed, find all the useful and ornamental articles that
drowning Clarence saw in his dream, but doubtless we
might substitute for them things that he never dreamed
of, things that the eye of man was not as yet cultivated
to see. What opportunities for enlarging the bounds of
science are possessed by the engineers that have been
working many hours a day, for years past, at the great
Breakwater in that prolific field of marine life, Weymouth
Bay!&mdash;working in a capacious diving-bell at the
bottom of the sea. But there are many reasons why
we can expect nothing in the way of natural history
from them. Perhaps not one of them has ever been
taught to think upon any of the strange forms that
might occur, which do not commonly minister to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
pocket of man in the market, as anything but mere
rubbish not worth a second glance, or something hurtful
or nasty to be crushed beneath the heel. Or if, perchance,
an observer of nature’s beauties be engaged in
such an occupation, his time would be so fully taken up
with his urgent duties, as to preclude attention to such
amenities. Besides which, the loads of enormous blocks
of stone already shot down on the sea-floor, which he
is there to arrange and settle, must pretty well have
smashed and covered everything which had revelled in
dull enjoyment there, before his arrival. Still I fancy
I should like to borrow his diving-bell on a holiday,
and roam a little beyond those wildernesses of broken
stone, picking up treasures here and there such as the
scraper of the dredge has never yet been able to gather
out of the crevices and crannies of those deep-water
rocks.</p>

<p>But such a desire is at present hopeless; and we
must be satisfied with such resources as are at our
command, thankful that the dredge, and the trawl, and
the keer-drag, the fisherman’s deep-sea line, the lobster-pot,
and the sounding-lead&mdash;are all contributing to our
acquaintance with the curious, the uncouth, the wondrous,
the beautiful, that lurk far down <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in profundis</i>.</p>

<p>Let us then go back to the results of our dredging
day that we so much enjoyed a few weeks ago. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
portion of its produce yet remains in buckets and pans,
waiting for a further overhauling; and it will doubtless
yield us some objects worthy of an hour or two’s investigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOBSTER-HORN CORALLINE.</div>

<p>The first thing that our fingers pull up is a great
tangled group of Sertularian <i>Hydrozoa</i>, of which the
finest part consists of some half-dozen stems of <i>Antennularia</i>,
called, from obvious resemblance, the Lobster-horn
Coralline.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> These are nearly straight, somewhat
stiff, unbranched stems, a foot or more in length, with
an uniform thickness of about a line, of a buff-yellow
hue, closely divided into short joints. Each of the
joints gives origin to a whorl of very delicate bristles,
giving a hairy appearance to the whole affair, but which
under magnifying power are discerned to be colourless,
jointed filaments, bearing on the inner shoulder of each
joint a tiny glassy cup (<i>hydrotheca</i>), within which resides
a minute many-tentacled polype. The stems
spring in close groups from an obscure root-mass of
tangled threads, which cling to stones and shells, and
afford a mooring to the Lobster-horn, which in its turn
affords support to miniature forests of other <i>Hydrozoa</i>,
slenderer than the finest hair&mdash;<i>Laomedea</i>, <i>Campanularia</i>,
etc., which crowd together on it, especially around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
bottom, and make the investigation of any one specimen
very difficult. These have their polype-cups of exquisitely
elegant forms, and I see on the latter many
of the urn-shaped vessels (now called <i>gonotheca</i>), out of
which issue what appear to be distinct and independent
forms of life, as unlike the parent as can well be imagined,
but exactly like the little naked-eyed Medusæ
that we lately looked at. This, however, is not properly
an animal at all, but only an organ (the <i>gonophore</i>)
which has the faculty of maintaining a separate existence,
and which is destined to give birth to ciliated
embryos, like the <i>planula</i> of the <i>Aurelia</i>, that attach
themselves, and develop into new <i>Campanulariæ</i>. Most
wonderful are the processes and phases of life which
have been discovered in these zoophytic forms.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> A
volume might be written on them, full of praise to the
all-wise God.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">SCALPELLUM.</div>

<p>Now, however, we must turn aside to look at other
objects. Attached to the base of the Lobster-horn, we
find several examples of an interesting Cirripede.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It
is of a dirty buff, or drab hue, semi-transparent, in outline
something like a butcher’s cleaver, handle and
blade, or still more like a silver butter-knife, but much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
thicker in proportion; the handle represented by the
cartilaginous and flexible stalk, the blade by the compressed
valves. These vary much in regularity of form,
some being nearly oval, little wider than the stalk,
others angular and much wider. The body throws
itself vigorously about on the stalk, when disturbed.
The valves open, and out comes a widely radiating hand,
of brilliantly glassy fingers, the joints and comb-like
bristles of which glitter and sparkle as I hold it up in
a tumbler of sea-water, examining it with a lens, with
a lamp behind. It remains some seconds expanded, as
if enjoying contact with the water; or perhaps, if I
may draw inferences from some slight twitchings, feeling
and testing for the accidental presence of invisible
atoms that might serve it for food; then suddenly the
fingers close together, and the hand is drawn in with a
snap, as if it had taken some prize, though the lens had
revealed nothing there. Soon it opens again, and
exhibits the same manœuvres. A front view of the
hand, the bristle-like fingers radiating in all directions,
is a very attractive object for a low magnifying power.
There are several tiny ones in another group, the bodies
of which are not bigger than hempseed; these make
their grasps apparently at random, with regular alternation,
much as the commoner Barnacles do.</p>

<p>Of these latter we have no lack, many of the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
shells and small pebbles being incrusted with crowded
colonies of the commonest Acorn Barnacle.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> We see
the same species, by tens of thousands, covering roods
and roods of the seaward surfaces of our rough rocks
between tide-marks. They rarely exceed one-third
of an inch in diameter at base; but there is a much
more massive kind, rough with ridges and furrows,
and hence called <i>porcate</i>, occasionally found adhering
to the jutting angles of rocks hereabout, and much
more commonly on the coast of South Wales, around
Tenby.</p>

<p>These Acorn Barnacles have no foot-stalk, but adhere
by the whole broad base to the rock or shell, on which
a floor either of strong stone, or of thin membrane is
formed, and from whose margin the stony plates arise,
enclosing a more or less conical chamber, with an orifice
at the summit. If we look in at this during the life of
the animal, we discern, a little below the rim, some
angular valves, which meet with a straight suture, and
close the interior. These are moveable, however; and
under water they open like folding-doors, and a hand
of many fingers, each composed of many joints, modelled
on the same plan as that of the <i>Scalpellum</i>, but less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
delicate, protrudes, which makes its cast for prey, and is
withdrawn beneath the again-closed valves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NECKED BARNACLES.</div>

<p>The winds and waves not unfrequently bear into our
harbours fragments of spars, old water-casks, or planks,
from the hull of some ill-fated ship foundered in the
inhospitable ocean, which are teeming with life. Conspicuous
on such “flotsam and jetsam,” as our ancient
maritime law-codes term these relics, we mark the
Necked Barnacles,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> so long believed by our ancestors,
with a most implicit credence, to be legitimately descended
from, and to be in turn the regular and normal
parents of, a certain species of goose, common enough on
our northern shores. That myth may, however, be
dismissed with a mere recollection.</p>

<p>In this form the neck or stalk is greatly developed,
frequently reaching to eight inches and upwards in
length, with a thickness of half an inch. Externally
it is very tough and leathery, yet it is sufficiently flexible
to be jerked vigorously in various directions, and thrown
into contorted curves, by means of muscles that run
through it. The lower part adheres firmly to the support,
which is generally wood, and I believe only in a
floating condition. The bottoms of ships in warm
climates are generally much infested with these para<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>sites,
which acquire a great size in the course of a voyage
of only a few months.</p>

<p>The valves resemble delicate shells, and are elegantly
painted with various tints of light blue varied with white,
the edges of the valves being often rich scarlet or orange.
The hand is deep purplish black, the fingers stout and
massive; but not differing in their structure or in their
mode of use, from those of their sessile fellows.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of all our native forms
of these Cirripedes&mdash;for true parasitism is always a subject
of peculiar interest&mdash;is that little species<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> which
invariably selects as its support the stony walls of a
coral. Our beautiful Cup-coral, so common at extreme
low-water level on both the north and south coasts of
Devon and Cornwall, is the favourite species of the
<i>Pyrgoma</i>. So far as my experience goes, extending over
a very extensive series of specimens, I think about one
in six of these corals carries the parasite, generally situated
either on, or just without, the margin of the cup.
I say, “generally,” because Mr. Guyon has lately recorded
what he thinks an exception to the rule, in two
<i>Pyrgomata</i> situated on the rock close to the base of the
coral. But Mr. Holdsworth, an excellent authority, considers
that the exception is more apparent than real.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
The number of these little intruders varies from one
upwards. I possess specimens, one of which carries
nine, the other eleven; the appearance of the ovate
barnacles, each with its conspicuous orifice, crowded
all round the edge of the coral, is exceedingly curious
and novel. Mr. Holdsworth mentions, however, that
he has seen fourteen <i>Pyrgomata</i> attached to a single
<i>Caryophyllia</i>, which was dredged in Plymouth Sound.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CIRRIPED TRANSFORMATIONS.</div>

<p>The transformations of these animals, as investigated
by Mr. Darwin, are of great interest. The Cirripede,
whatever its genus, and whatever its peculiarities of
adult existence, begins its life in a form exactly like
that of a young Entomostracous Crustacean, with a
broad carapace, a single eye, two pairs of antennæ, three
pairs of jointed, branched, and well-bristled legs, and a
forked tail. It casts off its skin twice, undergoing,
especially at the second moult, a considerable change
of figure. At the third moult it has assumed almost
the form of a <i>Cypris</i>, or <i>Cythere</i>, being enclosed in a
bivalve shell, in which the front of the head with the
antennæ is greatly developed, equalling in bulk all the
rest of the body. The single eye has become two, which
are very large, and attached to the outer arms of two
bent processes like the letters <span class="smcap lowercase">U U</span>, which are seen within
the thorax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>In this stage the little animal searches about for some
spot suitable for permanent residence; a ship’s bottom,
a piece of floating timber, the back of a whale or turtle,
or the solid rock. When its selection is made, the two
antennæ, which project from the shell, pour out a glutinous
gum or cement, which hardens in water, and firmly
attaches them. Henceforth the animal is a fixture,
glued by the front of its head to its support. Another
moult now takes place; the bivalve shell is thrown off,
with the great eyes, and their <span class="smcap lowercase">U</span>-like processes, and the
little Cirripede is seen in its true form. It is now in
effect a Stomapod Crustacean, attached by its antennæ,
the head greatly lengthened (in <i>Lepas</i>, etc.), the carapace
composed of several pieces (valves), the legs modified
into cirri, and made to execute their grasping movements
backwards instead of forwards, and the whole
abdomen obliterated, or reduced to an inconspicuous
rudiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SERPULA.</div>

<p>Let us resume our grubbing in the heterogeneous heap
of matters with which the dredge has enriched us. The
tube-dwelling <i>Annelida</i> are generally prominent in such
collections, and accordingly we see conspicuous here
great and small heaps of contorted tubes, that look as
if a batch of tobacco-pipe stems had become agglutinated
together, and strangely twisted in the baking.
These are the shelly tubes of the beautiful scarlet Serpula,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
a general favourite in our aquaria, easily and
abundantly procured, and readily maintained in health
and beauty for a considerable period. I need scarcely
describe the general appearance of an object so commonly
kept, and so frequently gazed upon. Many tubes
are usually found growing together, adhering to the
same shell, bit of broken pottery, or small stone; all
much intertwined, and mutually adherent, so that it is
practically hopeless to attempt to isolate one. Yet by
studying many specimens we are able to ascertain that
each individual is at first a very slender tube of white
calcareous shell, not thicker than sewing-cotton;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> this
rapidly increases both in thickness and in length, soon
rising from its support, to which it at first adhered by
the lime deposited in a soft state, and continuing the
rest of its growth free, in a direction forming various
angles with the ground line, and most irregularly twined
and contorted. For the final half of its length, or thereabout,
the tube attains a diameter of one-fourth of an
inch, the walls being sufficiently thick to be solid, yet
leaving an ample cavity for the residence of the industrious
mechanic, who thus skilfully builds up his own house.</p>

SCARLET SERPULA.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>If we carefully break, by a moderated blow with a
hammer, the shelly tube, so as not to crush the tenant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
we are able to expose the latter to view. We then see
that its length is by no means commensurate with the
length of its house, of which indeed it inhabits only the
last-made portion, having behind a roomy space into
which to retire in case of need. It is not more than an
inch or an inch and a quarter long, rather wide in proportion,
and flattened, with a well-marked distinction between
the corslet and the abdomen. The former carries
on each side prominent foot-warts, which are vigorously
protrusile, and within which bundles of strong bristles
are thrust to and fro. On the upper part of each foot,
extending half across the back, is a row of microscopic
hooks, wielded by long thread-like tendons, which are
fixed, on mechanical principles, to the attached end of
each hook. By the aid of these, the Serpula so cleverly
withdraws with lightning-like rapidity on alarm. By
the action of muscles of indescribable delicacy, the
hooks are projected to some distance beyond the surface
of the body. These organs are formed on the
model of a hedger’s bill-hook, only that the edge is cut
into long teeth. Carefully counting them I have found
that each Serpula carries about 1900 such hooks on its
corslet, and that each of these being cut into seven teeth,
there are between 13,000 and 14,000 teeth employed in
catching the lining membrane of the tube, and in drawing
the animal back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>The protrusion of the fore parts, which takes place
in a much more leisurely manner, is performed by quite
another set of instruments, formed on a totally different
principle. Their action is a pushing or shoving. The
instruments for effecting this are the fine but strong
bristles which run through the feet. Each bristle is
composed of a strong rigid unyielding shaft, having an
expanded shoulder drawn out into a point. On one side
of this pointed shoulder may be remarked a double row
of fine teeth, admirably calculated to catch against any
roughnesses of the surface with which they come into
contact, against which they then push with the force
of the proper muscles. Acting diagonally backwards,
from the two sides of the animal, the result of the combination
of the forces is that the animal itself is pushed
forwards, and so protruded from the mouth of the tube.
The feet on the hinder portion of the body are, according
to Dr. Williams,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> modified in structure with express
reference to the duties of mopping, sweeping, scraping,
and wiping the inferior closed end of the habitation.
I think, however, he has forgotten that this end, formed
by the animal in its infant state, must now be very much
too strait to be reached by any portion of the body, or
by any of its organs.</p>

<p>Dwelling in a tubular house, the Serpula would find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
its breathing organs scarcely available, if these were
placed, as in most <i>Annelida</i>, in pairs on the body-segments.
They are therefore much modified, and that
not only in position but in form. They consist of most
elegant comb-like filaments, richly coloured, arranged
in two rows around the front extremity, one row on
each side of the mouth. They are graduated in length,
and are so affixed, that, where the rows meet behind,
they can be thrown-in, so that a vertical view of the
circular coronet shows a great sinus in it. These brilliant
gill-tufts form the most attractive feature in these
elegant Worms, and are individually most exquisite
examples of mechanical contrivance. Examined under
a low microscopic power, they present a most charming
spectacle. Each filament consists of a pellucid cartilaginous
stem, from one side of which springs a double
row of secondary filaments like the teeth of a comb.
Within both stem and filaments the red blood may be
seen, with beautiful distinctness, driven along the artery,
and back by the vein (which are placed close side by
side) in ceaseless course, constituting a very striking
spectacle.</p>

<p>The exterior of these organs is set with strong cilia,
so arranged that the water-current is vigorously driven
upward along one side of the filament, and downward
along the other. Yet the combined result of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
branchial currents is to bring a powerful vortex into
the enclosed funnel, the bottom of which terminates in
the mouth. The food which sustains nutrition is thus
brought to be swallowed, a large quantity of water being
at the same time constantly poured into the body; this
is discharged (by the agency of a ciliated lining of the
hinder parts) in the form of a strong current, which, impinging
against the closed end of the tube, is turned
upward, carrying with it all extraneous or fœcal matters,
and is ever pouring out of the frontal extremity
around the neck of the creature. What a beautiful and
effective contrivance is this for constantly keeping in a
state of the most unsullied cleanness the interior of the
house! It reminds one of the fabled Hercules cleansing
the Augean stable by driving the river Peneus
through it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ITS STOPPER.</div>

<p>On each side of the mouth there springs a lengthened
horny thread, appearing to answer to the antennæ
which in other Worms, as well as in Insects and Crustacea,
project from the front of the head. Such seems
their true relation considered structurally, but in function
and office they are very remarkable and quite
peculiar. To these organs is assigned the duty of
closing up the tube when the animal has withdrawn its
gaily-coloured plumes; and for this end, one of these
antennæ is much lengthened, and at the end is ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>panded
into a broad trumpet-shaped club, the extremity
of which is somewhat concave, and is delicately marked
with radiating grooves. This organ is usually painted
with the same brilliant colours as the gill-tufts, and by
its length, size, and form, makes a very conspicuous
feature in the charming Serpula. Its length is such,
that when the gill-filaments are rolled up and withdrawn,
the conical club enters after all, and is found
accurately to fit the trumpet-like orifice of the tube,
just as a cork fits tightly into the mouth of a bottle.</p>

<p>Ordinarily those organs which appear in pairs are
formed so as to be the counterparts of each other. But
here is an exception. One only, sometimes the right,
sometimes the left, indifferently, takes the remarkable
form that I have been describing, the other being much
shorter, and terminating only in a small knob, like the
head of a pin. Why should there be this difference?
Why this exception to an all but universal rule? The
reason is obvious. Yes, obvious enough when seen and
noticed; but it tells an eloquent tale of the Divine
forethought and care. If both of the antennæ were
furnished with the terminal cone, one would interfere
with the other in the performance of their closing,
corking-up function; they would jam in the doorway,
and the tube would be left open. Hence the one is
left undeveloped, yet retaining, as I believe, the latent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
power of expanding into a cone, if it should ever be
needed by the accidental loss of the fellow now so furnished.
I thus judge, because experience shows me
that the conical club is occasionally thrown off, and
quickly renewed, in captivity.</p>

<p>My esteemed friend, the Rev. Sir Christopher Lighton,
has indeed put on record an example of a Serpula of
this species possessing two equal antennæ, that had
replaced the single one accidentally lost. They were
both perfectly developed, and joined together near the
base. Each was decidedly smaller than the single one
that had formerly occupied their place.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This exceedingly
interesting case can, of course, only be regarded
as a monstrosity of redundancy, as children are sometimes
born with a superfluous finger. But it is valuable
as showing that there is a power of development latent
in the crownless antenna. I wish very much that the
excellent observer had added a note, telling us to what
extent the tube was closed, and how the work was performed
without mutual interference.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes brought as an objection to
our assigning a certain service to certain organs, that
the necessity for such service is a gratuitous supposition,
since other creatures similarly formed in most
respects, and in which we might infer a like need, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
no such supply. We may admit the facts, but refuse the
reasoning. There can be no manner of doubt that the
conical antenna does act as a stopper to the Serpula, as
our eyes can see; and surely it would be most unphilosophical
to suppose that the function so performed is
not serviceable to the creature. Yet its near cousins,
the Sabellæ, similarly constructed, and of similar habits
of life, and as we should have <i>à priori</i> supposed, quite
as liable to injury in the same direction, are entirely
destitute of this contrivance for protection, and of anything
compensating for it, so far as is known. Why
the need of one should be met by such a beautiful contrivance,
while the same need in the other is wholly
unmet, though both are formed by the same Infinite
God, is one of those unanswerable questions which, while
they leave unimpeached His wisdom, make us deeply
conscious of our own ignorance.</p>

<p>We find numerous examples of this genus <i>Sabella</i> in
our confused heap of tangled life and death. By their
vigour and their abundance we have proof enough that
their wants <i>are</i> supplied, though they do not enjoy
this special contrivance: they manage to live and thrive
and enjoy themselves, with open doors, taking all risks
of insidious robbers,&mdash;such, for instance, as that vile
burglar, the Longworm,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> that we found under a stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
the other day; which is ever on the watch to insert its
snaky head within the unprotected tube, and to tear
away with merciless clutch the beauteous gill-tufts.</p>

SABELLÆ.
</p></div>
</div>

<p>One species of this genus<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> can by the cursory observer
be distinguished from the Serpulæ, only by this
absence of the antennal stopper. For it dwells in a
shelly tube, essentially resembling those which we have
just been examining. It has peculiarities of detail,
however. It is never found associated with numbers
of its fellows in agglutinated groups, but always, so far
as my experience goes, singly. It is more common on
shells than on stones, generally attached to the old
valve of some cockle or scallop. It is straight or
nearly so, never at least contorted. Attached only for
a very short portion of its smaller end, perhaps for an
inch or so, for which it creeps along the surface, it then
rises into a more or less erect position, extending sometimes
to a height of seven or eight inches perfectly
free. The tube is of about the same diameter as that of
the Serpula, but is slighter in structure, or perhaps it
appears so, because it is destitute of those expansions
which here and there in that species indicate the trumpet-lips
of successive stages of development. The extremity
of the tube here is simple, not expanding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Slight annular rings, however, do here and there vary
the shelly surface of the tube.</p>

<p>The gill-tufts are ample; they are two, considerably
infolded, consisting of about forty-five filaments each,
which are much longer and slenderer than those of the
Serpula, the last filaments of the volutions diminishing
rapidly. The secondary filaments, or pinnæ, are very
fine and very numerous, so set on the main stem that
the two rows form the sides of a narrow groove, facing
inwards. The whole is yellowish-white with eight or
ten bright scarlet dots set with intervals all along the
back or outer side of the stem. When fully protruded,
the base of the gills, and even a good deal of the neck,
lolls out of the tube. If the animal be removed, the
body is seen to be white, elegantly banded with scarlet,
and furnished with a broad translucent collar, edged with
scarlet: this collar ordinarily lines the mouth of the tube.</p>

<p>From the length and isolation of its shelly tube this
is a remarkable species: the great tenuity of its filaments,
however, requires a lens to bring out their
beauties; but with this aid, the arrangement of the
rich scarlet bands and spots on the pale yellow ground
cannot fail to evoke admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SABELLÆ.</div>

<p>In general, the Sabellæ inhabit tubes which are not
calcareous or shelly; they are composed of a soft flexible
substance somewhat resembling wet parchment, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of a secretion from the animal’s body, in which the
impalpable muddy sediment which the waves agitate,
consisting of decomposed organic matter for the most
part, is interwoven. The tissue so made is sufficiently
tough and enduring, retaining its form long after the
animal has died out of it.</p>

<p>In our dredge-hauls we find a pretty little kind<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
common enough, which lives in association, the tubes
apparently from half-an-inch to an inch in length,
forming dense masses on stones and shells, and projecting
in every direction. A dozen or more may be in one
group, and when all are alive, one or another protruding
or retiring every moment, it makes a pretty object.</p>

<p>The gill-filaments are nine to eleven in each row, of
a yellowish white, occasionally patched with dead-white,
or red-brown: delicately and densely pinnate.
The filaments, in the act of protruding, are closed
together like a straight bundle of rods which suddenly
fall open at the ends. In this moment of unfolding,
their tips are seen to be a little hooked inwards. The
tube is about as large as a crow-quill; under a lens it
appears speckled, as if the inorganic matter imbedded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
in it were grains of the finest sand. On carefully removing
all the surrounding tubes and other objects so
as to isolate one, we see that it is truly about three
inches in length, but that two-thirds of the whole are
prostrate and adherent; this basal portion is horny and
pellucid, no mud entering into its texture. The animal
when extracted is an inch in length, of which the gill-tufts
form one-third.</p>

<p>Mingled with these there are one or two specimens
of a much more imposing species, the Hook-plumed
Sabella.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> It grows to a large size, the crown of gill-filaments
sometimes attaining a height of an inch, and
the same diameter. The two rows are incurved in
regular spirals of half a turn, each consisting of about
eighteen filaments, which are rather stout, the whole
crown sometimes taking the form of a funnel, sometimes
that of a cup, often arching inward at the tip.
Their pinnæ are long and close, the two rows forming
a groove, but nearly parallel. Each primary stem is
set along the back with twelve pairs of feather-like
processes, hooked downwards;&mdash;a very remarkable
character, and one by which this species may be in a
moment distinguished. Their colour is pale red-brown,
mottled irregularly with deep brownish purple and with
white; there is a pair of brown specks at the origin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
each pair of hooks. The base of the crown is always
concealed in the mouth of the tube, but it springs from
a narrow frilled membrane of pure white. The body is
destitute of a thoracic shield, or conspicuous collar.
The tube is largely composed of soft homogeneous mud,
usually of a pale purplish hue, of about the thickness of
the shelly tube of <i>S. tubularia</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TUBE-BUILDING.</div>

<p>The process of building the mud tubes of the Sabellæ
is a very interesting one. It is performed, according to my
own observations,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> mainly by means of the gill-filaments
and their pinnal grooves. The filaments are bent-over,
till the inner or grooved face comes in contact with the
soft mud on which the animal is lying, when the sensitive
pinnæ close on a minute portion of the mud, taking
it up in a pellet, which is then fashioned by the form
of the groove; the filament is now erected, and the
pellet, passing down the groove to the bottom by means
of the cilia, is delivered to the care of two delicate
moveable organs, like leaves or flaps, which place it on
the edge of the tube, and then shape and mould it,
smoothing both surfaces. Doubtless, either from these
organs, or from some other part of the circumjacent
region, the glutinous secretion is at the same time
poured out, which consolidates the mud, and forms the
true basis of the tube.</p>

<h2>XII.<br />

DECEMBER.</h2>


<p>December is here, with its short days, its feeble
watery sunshine, its frequent gloom and mist, its hanging
leaden skies; in short, as the poet describes it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
“Sullen and sad, with all his rising train;</div>
<div class="verse">
Vapours and clouds and storms.”
</div></div></div>

<p>It requires some zeal in the pursuit of scientific lore
to leave the glowing fire and the pleasant book, the
luxurious arm-chair and the elastic carpet, and to venture
down to the wild sea-beach, to poke and peer
among the desolate rocks. Yet even now we may find
a few bright days, when Nature abroad looks inviting,
and when an hour’s marine research will prove neither
unpleasant nor unsuccessful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SQUIRTERS.</div>

<p>On such a noon, then, calm and quiet, the sun bright
and cheerful, if low and feeble, the tide tolerably low
and the rocks accessible, we hie down to some one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
other of those ledges which have so often already yielded
their treasures to our search, and begin our wonted
labours at turning over the heavy angular masses. We
soon find, attached to the under surfaces of these, what
seem to be irregular blobs of coloured jelly of somewhat
firm consistence, as if an invalid had been here
eating his calves’-foot jelly, whose trembling hand had
dropped sundry spoonfuls on the stones. Some appear
as flattish shapeless drops, but others take more elevated
forms, like sacks set on end, and usually displaying
two mouths. One of these is of a pellucid yellowish
green, or olive hue, with a cloudy spot of rich orange
in the interior. A slight shrinking from the touch, a
yet closer contraction of the projecting points, is the
only token of life that we can discern in it now; but
if we place it in an aquarium,&mdash;not forcibly removing
it from its attachment, but lifting the shell or stone on
which it rests; or, if this be too large, detaching the
fragment with a chisel,&mdash;and allow it to remain a few
hours undisturbed, we shall see evidences of a vitality,
indubitable if not very active.</p>

<p>The whole creature is now much plumper and more
pellucid; it stands up boldly from its base on the stone;
its upper portion is much lengthened, and the two wart-like
eminences have become two short tubes with gaping
extremities, appearing as if they had been soldered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>gether
side by side, of which the one is considerably
higher than the other.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>We have before us one of the <i>Tunicata</i>, an order of
molluscous animals which are closely allied to the <i>Conchifera</i>
or bivalves, but somewhat lower in the scale
than they. It has no shell; that is to say, lime is not
deposited in the outer investment, so as to give it the
hard, rigid, solid texture of shell; but the internal
organs, which are essentially similar to those of an
Oyster or a Sand-gaper, are enclosed in a tough leathery
coat, known as the <i>test</i>, which is in fact a closed shell
destitute of lime. The eminent physiologist, John
Hunter, who had dissected some of these homely Squirters,
as they are familiarly called, recognised, with his
wonted acumen, the structural similarity of their
leathery envelopes to the stony shells of the lower
bivalves; and, associating them in a group, called
them “soft-shells.” The naturalness of this group, since
called <i>Tunicata</i> by Lamarck, has been recognised by
modern zoologists.</p>

</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE GILL-SAC.</div>

<p>If we watch our Ascidia for a few minutes, we perceive
that at irregular intervals one or both of the
gaping orifices are suddenly closed and contracted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
commonly both at the same instant. They are, however,
soon opened again; and we may discern, especially
if the specimen is in a glass vessel, and we watch
it by the aid of a lens, with the light of a window at its
back, that a current of the surrounding water flows
from all sides to the taller orifice, and pours down its
tube; while occasionally we see the ejection of a stream
from the orifice of the shorter tube. Thus we have here
a receiving and a discharging tube, the exact representatives
of the two siphons in such bivalves as
<i>Pholas</i>, <i>Venus</i>, etc. The former leads down into a capacious
sac in the interior, the walls of which constitute
the breathing apparatus. The inner surface is marked
by regular parallel ridges which run in a horizontal
direction; and these are again connected by vertical
ridges at right angles, very numerous, enclosing a vast
number of oval compartments. The sides of these are
richly ciliated; and if the whole apparatus be carefully
dissected out, and laid upon the stage of the microscope,
the course of the ciliary currents may be distinctly
seen, continuing with unabated vigour and with unfaltering
precision for a long time after the severance of
the organ from the body of the animal. But all this
is seen to most advantage, if we select one of the smaller
species, which are brilliantly transparent, such as one
which grows in groups of elegant tall vases, about an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
inch in height, around the edges of our rocky pools,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> or
a tiny thing which forms a little heap of transparent
globules, like pins’ heads, attached to sea-weeds.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In
either of these, placed in a stage-trough of sea-water,
we can watch at leisure the performance of the various
vital functions in healthy action, with the knowledge
that the little subject has not been martyred to science,
but is all the while enjoying its humble life with perhaps
as much zest as if it were still environed by the
rough walls of its little native basin of rock.</p>

<p>In the tiny pin-head of clear jelly, the microscope
displays the branchial sac hanging free in the cavity,
like a bag of clear muslin. The oval cavities divided-off
by the rectangular ridges are about forty in number,
around each of which the ciliary waves incessantly roll,
as running spots of black. It is a very charming spectacle
to see so many oblong figures set symmetrically,
all furnished on their inner surface with what look like
the cogs or teeth of a mill-wheel, dark and distinct,
running round and round with an even, moderately
rapid, ceaseless course. These black, well-defined,
tooth-like specks are merely an optical effect; they do
not represent any actual objects, but only the waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
which the cilia make: the cilia themselves being hairs,
so fine as to be defined only with high powers. Occasionally
we see one or other of the ovals suddenly cease
its movement, while the rest go on; and now and then
the whole are arrested simultaneously, and presently
all start off again together, with a very pleasing effect,
as if we were looking at the wheels of a very perfect
and complex piece of machinery. These phenomena
appear to indicate that the movements are under the
control of the animal’s will, capable of being suspended
or continued, wholly, or in any degree, at pleasure;
which is not the case in the higher animals; our own
respiratory movement, for example, as well as the pulsations
of the heart, going on without the concurrence of
our will, and even without our consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HEART.</div>

<p>The action of the heart in these transparent creatures
is equally visible. Below the muslin curtain with its
living chambers, down at the very bottom of the body-cavity,
there is a transparent sac of membrane, which
takes the appearance of a long bag, pointed at each end,
but not closed, and strangely twisted on its long axis,
so as to make three turns. This is the heart; and
within it are seen many colourless globules, floating
freely in a clear fluid, which answers to the blood.
This circulates throughout the system in the following
manner:&mdash;We see a spasmodic contraction at one end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of the bag, which drives forward the globules contained
there; the contraction in an instant passes onward
along the three twists of the vessel, the part behind
expanding immediately as the movement passes on, and
the globules are forcibly expelled through the narrow
but open extremity. Meanwhile the free globules surrounding
the commencing end have rushed in as soon as
that part resumed its usual width, and are in their turn
driven forward by the periodic repetition of the pulsation.
The fluid, with its globules thus put in motion,
is then driven along through the interstices of the various
organs of the body, not through a system of closed blood-vessels,
some finding their way along the transverse
lines that separate the rows of gill-ovals, until they
sooner or later arrive at the point where they entered
the heart, to take the same course over again.</p>

<p>As in the kindred forms of animal life, the same
orifice, the same cilia, the same currents are subservient
to breathing and to the reception of food; the stomach
digesting the microscopic animalcules which are poured
with the entering stream through the receiving siphon.
At some distance within the interior of this orifice
there are a series of thread-shaped tentacles, affixed in
a ring, which we may suppose to exercise some kind of
superintendence, by touch or other perception, over the
atoms which indiscriminately enter upon the stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
accepting or rejecting. Probably it is in the exercise
of the latter discretion that those irregular regurgitations
of the current take place, accompanied by a
momentary closing of the mouth, that we frequently
notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EYES.</div>

<p>Still further ancillary to the protection of the stomach
from the intrusion of inimical matters, we may safely
suppose certain eye-like specks which are placed at the
very vestibule. In the larger species, as this red-clouded
green Squirter, there are seated in special
fissures at the very margin of the expanded siphon-orifices,
red dots,&mdash;eight around the receiving, six
around the ejecting, siphon. Each dot seems ascertained
to be an eye of very rudimentary structure,
seated on a mass of orange pigment. We should probably
do wrong if we attributed any higher vision to
these organs than a low degree of sensibility to the
general stimulus of the light.</p>

<p>Some species have the orifices of the siphons four-cornered,
whereas the sort I have been describing have
them circular; there are differences also in the breathing
sac, which in the square-mouthed species is folded
lengthwise, while in the round-mouthed it is plain.
Hence the former have been separated from the <i>Ascidiæ</i>,
as a distinct genus, named <i>Cynthia</i>; both including a
large number of species.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>We have a pretty attractive little <i>Cynthia</i> in our
dredging,&mdash;the Currant Squirter.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It is not uncommon
in deep water off this coast, and in Weymouth Bay;
frequently occurring in family groups crowded together
on old shells. Generally there is one of superior dimensions
to the rest, the venerable parent of the colony;
and, surrounding him, others of varying size, and (doubtless)
age, down to very minute infants. The full size is
about that of half a small cherry; but it is more usual
to see them not exceeding that of half a red currant.
These comparisons will also give a fair idea of their
shape and colour, especially in a state of contraction,
as when lifted from the water: for they are little hemispheres
of a brilliant, scarcely pellucid, crimson hue,
seated on the shell by the whole broad base. Under
water, and at ease, the form becomes more conical,
rising into a point; whence, in full expansion, the two
siphons protrude, slightly divergent, and the one a little
superior to the other, each opening by a distinctly quadrangular
orifice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUR-ANGLED SQUIRTER.</div>

<p>Contrasting with this neat and pretty little family,
we have here another species of the genus, the Four-angled
Squirter.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> You would hardly suppose this to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
an animal at all, if uninitiated; but might readily pass
it over as a rude stone, or a bit of wood roughly bruised
and worn by the waves beating it among the rocks, so
uncouth and coarse and shapeless it is. It forms a great
mass, some two inches high, rudely four-sided, of a dull
yellowish-olive hue, rising into two blunt eminences,
which individually retain the quadrangular shape, and
in activity open by symmetrically quadrangular orifices.
It is a sluggish, unattractive lump of flesh, somewhat
between leather and jelly in texture, coarsely
pellucid, but not transparent, and its exterior is usually
distinguished by various extraneous matters imbedded
in the test, as well as by forests of tangled zoophytes
which creep over it and root in it as on the rock. The
surface itself, moreover, is much corrugated by an irregular
network of depressions, marking off angular warty
areas.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the little Currant is a pleasing
inhabitant of the aquarium. Of manners, to be sure, it
has not much, good or bad, but the form and colour
are agreeable; as is also the effect produced by the
grouping of the brilliant drops of jelly. Little of change
takes place, beyond the occasional contraction and reprotrusion
of the orifices; but sometimes you may see,
as I have seen, at certain times, the laying of eggs by
this species, which is an interesting phenomenon. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
are perfectly globular, about the size of small shot or
pins’ heads, of a rich scarlet-crimson hue: they are deposited
in a singular manner. The oviduct does not
extend to the exterior of the body, but discharges the
eggs into a large cavity formed by the mouth, of which
the discharging siphon is the outlet. From this orifice,
then, they are expelled, shot out perpendicularly with
considerable force, so that they describe arched courses
through the water, like bombs shot from a mortar, rising
to a height ten times that of the animal. I have observed
a dozen or more eggs thus discharged in quick
succession, which then fall to the bottom around the
parent, destined to constitute one of those family groups
in which we usually find the species.</p>

<p>I have not been successful in rearing these eggs to
maturity. The development of the <i>Tunicata</i> has, however,
been observed by various naturalists, and by none
more thoroughly than by the late Sir John Dalyell, whose
elaborate and costly works, profusely illustrated, are
such a mine of information respecting the lower forms
of marine life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRANSFORMATIONS.</div>

<p>The young escapes from the egg in a form as unlike
the parent as can be imagined. It is a flat ovate body
with a long flat tail, altogether presenting a curious
resemblance to the tadpole of a frog. In this condition
I have found the larva of the <i>Clavelina</i>, and have fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>lowed
it to the development of the <i>Ascidia</i> form. By
means of the rapid vibrations of the powerful tail, the
little tadpole swims for short distances through the
water, with more effort than effect. After a while, it
rests; swims again, and again rests; till at last it moves
no more. A coloured eye-speck is visible on the surface,
destined to be absorbed; the tail is beginning to
disappear (in some cases it is separated by a spontaneous
constriction at its junction with the body, in others it
appears to be gradually absorbed); one or more warts
are seen budding from the opposite extremity of the
body. These last secrete a cement by which the animal
is finally attached to its support, shell, stone, or sea-weed,
either growing out into creeping and adherent
root-threads, or enlarging into a broad base, from which
the body begins to grow upward. After a while the
two orifices are formed; first within, on the mantle,
before the exterior test is pierced; then the internal
organs, the gill-sac, and the pulsating heart, if it be
one of the transparent species, become recognisable;
the single eye-speck, a temporary organ, pales and disappears;
and the permanent circles of visual organs
are formed around the siphonal orifices. And thus the
Ascidian is developed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOTRYLLI.</div>

<p>The genera <i>Ascidia</i> and <i>Cynthia</i> consist of isolated
distinct individuals; the <i>Clavelina</i> and the <i>Perophora</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
exist in the form of groups, composed of distinct individuals
associated by a common branching root-thread,
whence they irregularly bud forth. There are, however,
other genera, in which the compound life is more prominently
manifest, the individual being recognisable
only by carefully dissecting it out from the common
mass. To this form belong many gelatinous masses
which occur on our rocky coasts; one in particular,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> conspicuous
for its rich scarlet and orange colours, which
forms irregular pear-shaped lumps, that hang from low-lying
ledges, and that look not unlike strawberries.
This is extremely abundant. More attractive still are
the <i>Botrylli</i>,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> which doubtless many persons have gazed
on with admiration, wondering what they can be,&mdash;animal,
vegetable, or what. They look as if small
quantities of jelly had been spilt, sometimes on a stone,
sometimes on the broad leaf of a tangle, sometimes on
a shrubby sea-weed, entangling the twigs and leaves in
the gelatinous mass. When we look closely at such an
object, we see that it is studded with little starry systems
of oblong specks, of some bright colour contrasting with
the ground-tint;&mdash;perhaps the stars are bright orange
on a warm brown, or pale straw-colour on a chocolate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
ground, or green on an iron-grey. The stars vary in
outline, often being angular, often oval, or circular:
they vary, too, in dimensions, and in number of the constituent
specks; some may be a sixth of an inch in
diameter, and contain a dozen or more; others may be
less than half that size, and have no more than two or
three; or even a single speck may be seen here and
there, which has not yet begun to develop the starry
form.</p>

</div>

<p>Each bright speck in these radiating star-like systems
is an animal essentially of the Ascidian form, with
the following peculiarities. All have budded from one
primary individual, which was produced as a tiny tadpole,
from an egg: the manner and direction in which the
buds were put forth determining the starry arrangement.
There is a common gelatinous envelope, in which the
whole are imbedded, and which ever extends as the
individuals and systems multiply, and which seems to
have the power of developing isolated individuals
which have not budded in the ordinary way, but which
then produce others by budding, and so become the
commencing points of other systems. In each individual
the siphonal orifices are remote from each other,
the receiving one being placed on the circumference of
the ring or system, while the ejecting one is placed at
the opposite end, opening, in common with the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>charging
siphons of all of that system, into a central
main orifice, which rises out of the level with a circular
rim, and forms the dark centre of the system.</p>

<p>In the open ocean there are forms of <i>Tunicata</i> which
are not attached, but swim freely; and, what is surprising,
even compound forms are thus found, progressing
by a combined action. One of the most curious is
the genus <i>Pyrosoma</i>, which consists of long-bodied
Ascidians, so united in rings as to constitute a long,
free cylindrical tube, closed at one end and open at the
other. By the rhythmical contractions and dilatations
of the multitude, this great cylinder slowly swims
through the open sea. But the most interesting circumstance
in its history is that it is intensely luminous,
lighting up the midnight ocean with flashes of vivid
light, or seen gliding through the dark water like
glowing sticks of fire. So it is described by some
voyagers, perhaps with a little exaggeration, for Mr.
Bennett, to whom we are indebted for many valuable
remarks on oceanic zoology, speaks in more subdued
tones of it. His account of this and other pelagic
phosphorescence is very <span class="lock">interesting:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PYROSOMA.</div>

<p>“On the 8th of June,” he observes, “being then in
lat. 30° S., and long. 27° 5′ W., having fine weather and
a fresh south-easterly trade-wind, and the range of the
thermometer being from 78° to 84°, late at night, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
mate of the watch came and called me to witness a
very unusual appearance in the water, which he, on
first seeing it, considered to be breakers. On arriving
upon deck, this was found to be a very broad and
extensive sheet of phosphorescence, extending in a
direction from east to west, as far as the eye could
reach. The luminosity was confined to the range of
animals in this shoal, for there was no similar light in
any other direction. I immediately cast the towing-net
over the stern of the ship, as we approached nearer
the luminous streak, to ascertain the cause of this
extraordinary and so limited phenomenon. The ship
soon cleaved through the brilliant mass, from which,
by the disturbance, strong flashes of light were emitted;
and the shoal, judging from the time the vessel took
in passing through the mass, may have been a mile in
breadth. The passage of the vessel through them
increased the light around to a far stronger degree,
illuminating the ship. On taking in the towing-net,
it was found half filled with <i>Pyrosoma</i> (<i>Atlanticum?</i>),
which shone with a beautiful pale-greenish light; and
there were also a few shell-fish in the net at the same
time. After the mass had been passed through, the
light was still seen astern, until it became invisible in
the distance; and the whole of the ocean then became
hidden in the darkness as before this took place. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
scene was as novel as beautiful and interesting; more
so from my having ascertained, by capturing luminous
animals, the cause of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>“The second occasion of my meeting these creatures
was not exactly similar to the preceding; but though
also limited, was curious, as occurring in a high latitude,
during the winter season. It was on the 19th of
August, the weather dark and gloomy, with light breezes
from north-north-east, in lat. 40° 30′ S., and long. 138°
3′ E., being then distant about 368 miles from King’s
Island (at the western entrance of Bass’s Straits). It
was about eight o’clock <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> when the ship’s wake was
perceived to be luminous; and scintillations of the same
light were also abundant around. As this was unusual,
and had not been seen before, and it occasionally, also,
appeared in larger and smaller detached masses, giving
out a high degree of brilliancy, to ascertain the cause,
so unusual in high latitudes during the winter season,
I threw the towing-net overboard, and in twenty minutes
succeeded in capturing several <i>Pyrosomata</i>, giving out
their usual pale-green light; and it was, no doubt, detached
groups of these animals that were the occasion
of the light in question. The beautiful light given out
by these molluscous animals soon ceased to be seen
emitted from every part of their bodies; but by moving
them about it could be reproduced for some length of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
time after. As long as the luminosity of the ocean was
visible (which continued most part of the night), a
number of <i>Pyrosoma Atlanticum</i>, two species of <i>Phyllosoma</i>,
an animal apparently allied to <i>Leptocephalus</i>, as
well as several crustaceous animals (all of which I had
before considered as intertropical species), were caught
and preserved. At half-past ten <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> the temperature
of the atmosphere on deck was 52°, and that of the
water 51½°. The luminosity of the water gradually
decreased during the night, and towards morning was
no longer seen, nor on any subsequent night.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPONGES.</div>

<p>Let us come back from the wide world of waters, with
its nightly illuminations, and its other ten thousand
marvels, to our own homely and quiet beach. A tribe
of existences is awaiting our notice, which we have as
yet neglected; which yet we cannot fail to observe
whenever we peep beneath these boulders, and look at
these rocky ledges, just left exposed by the lowest retiring
tides. They are the Sponges; the most debateable
forms of life, long denied a right to stand in the
animal ranks at all, and even still admitted there doubtingly
and grudgingly by some excellent naturalists.
Yet such they certainly are, established beyond reasonable
controversy as true and proper examples of animal
life, and therefore having a rightful claim to be painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
and described in this series of essays. However, as they
are the lowest, so shall they be the last; for, with a few
notes on some of our species, I shall dismiss my kind
and courteous readers.</p>

<p>The inferior surface of this huge slab of limestone,
supported at one end by a boulder, while the other end
is imbedded in the mud or concealed by the smaller
fragments that are thrown in confusion around, is
densely studded with organisms. It is only at very
low tides that this arch is exposed, though now we can
creep in and work with no great discomfort, though
with some defilement of our garments from the mud
and slime. The absence of direct light is favourable to
the growth of marine productions, and thus we have
another congenial element in the obscurity. With some
of the smaller sea-weeds, chiefly of the filamentous
kinds, as <i>Cladophora</i>, <i>Conferva</i>, some of the minuter
<i>Callithamnia</i>, etc., the majority of the forms that crowd
and cover the rock so densely are animals: indeed
there are large areas where the animate forms struggle
so perseveringly for standing-room, that not a filament
or frond of vegetation can be seen, and you could not
thrust the point of a penknife down to the rock in any
spot without wounding some or other of the incrusting
creatures. <i>Polyzoa</i> are here, chiefly of the tufted
species; <i>Hydrozoa</i>, too, hang down; Anemones, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
not in abundance, may be seen; <i>Saxicavæ</i> push their
crimson siphons through, here and there; <i>Botrylli</i> are
spread in patches, and <i>Amœrœcia</i> are suspended like a
plentiful crop of tempting strawberries; but Sponges
constitute the staple of the crop; it is a veritable field
of Sponge.</p>

<p>I have on other occasions described some of the more
characteristic phenomena of this class of creatures;&mdash;the
volcanic eruptions of the Crumb-of-bread Sponge,
the hills and poles and webs of the Rosy Crumb, the
protrusile bladders of the Sanguine, the starry spicula
of the Flat-Sack.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> These I shall assume as known, and
shall confine myself to the enumeration and description
of a few other species which are found congregated on
this rocky roof.</p>

<p>One of the first to catch the eye, by its gorgeous
colour, is a rather thin, soft, spreading patch, of the
richest vermilion hue.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> It is of close substance, the
surface covered with shallow irregular sinuous channels
and minute orifices. It rarely exceeds an inch in
diameter, but throws out slender clinging processes
to some length. The flesh is dense. Under the microscope
it contains three-rayed spicula, which are for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the most part somewhat blunt, but some are very sharp.
After death it rapidly loses its brilliant hue, and dries
of a dull oak-brown.</p>

<p>Another occurs in the form of low irregular spreading
patches of a greyish black, very smooth and shiny,
more plump than the former, and a little larger.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> There
are no visible orifices on the surface. The substance
is yellowish grey, compact, with a distinct demarcation
from the thin black tough skin. The spicula of the
flesh have three rays in one plane, and one standing up
from it; very stout, sharp-pointed, with a distinct
canal running through the centre of each ray of the
larger ones. There are a few rods abruptly hooked at
the tip; a few very long, straight, and slender, with pin-like
heads; and a few simple needles, long, slender,
pointed at one or at both ends.</p>

<p>Some largish rounded masses occur, several inches in
diameter, and rising to a thickness of three-fourths of
an inch.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The surface is undulate, the summits slightly
ridged, covered with shallow sinuous channels having
sharp edges, not very confluent: large round mouth-orifices
(<i>oscula</i>) generally mark the summits of the
ridges. The colour of this fine species is a deep buff,
and its appearance is much like that of our Turkey
Sponge, with something of the same feel, but much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
firmer. The interior is full of channels. The spicula
here are very varied and interesting, comprising some
curious and unusual forms. Some, indeed, are simple
needles, nearly straight, pointed at one end rather
abruptly. The following are minute. There are a
number of rings interrupted at one side, like the letter
<img class="inlineimage" src="images/fatc.png" alt="fat letter C"/>, some thicker and more elliptical, others slender and
rounder, <img class="inlineimage" src="images/roundc.png" alt="round letter C"/>. A few take the form of the letter <img class="inlineimage" src="images/letters.png" alt="letter C"/>, but
having one lobe much more developed than the other.
Some of the <img class="inlineimage" src="images/roundc.png" alt="round letter C"/> form have both the extremities bifid, and
the points widely diverging; and some of these have
the back straight, instead of curved, and these with
their bifid points, look, when viewed in front, like
double anchors. All are, as usual, spun out of the
most brilliant glass.</p>

<p>Then we have in some abundance a sort<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> with firm
cartilaginous walls, about one-eighth of an inch thick,
standing up to the height of three-fourths, with rounded
summits, running in irregular sinuations and convolutions,
not unlike the cartilage of the human ear, enclosing
deep hollows. The colour is opaque white, tinged
with red, probably from the red mud, which is prevalent
here. When cut with a knife this sponge has a sharp,
crisp, gritty feel, and when a little is crushed between
glass plates we distinctly hear a creaking sound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
These phenomena depend on the circumstance that it
is almost wholly composed of great stout three-rayed
spicula, solid throughout, together with a multitude of
excessively slender needles, straight, long, pointed at
one end; and many others as slender, but very short;
no longer, indeed, than the thickness of one of the
three-rayed.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Equally numerous with these, and possessing a
certain amount of resemblance to them, are some thick,
compact, sack-shaped masses, with angular edges and
blunt points: sometimes they are flattened and dilated,
like a sack when empty; sometimes rounded, like a
sack when full. In the former condition several perforations
occur along the terminal ridge, in the latter
there is generally but one. The colour is white, slightly
tinted, just as in the preceding. It stands up boldly
and stiffly (or rather <i>hangs</i> in the natural state) from
its rather narrow base to the height of about two-thirds
of an inch, and the flattened specimens are as wide as
this. It is nearly made up of three-rayed spicula, some
of large size, but more rather small. A transverse
section shows no obvious arrangement, except that of
the great central channel, into which the points of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
spicula project; but a longitudinal section shows the
spicula built up one on another in many courses, so
nearly symmetrical that hexagonal canals are formed,
whose axes run transversely to the axis of the sponge;
<i>i.e.</i>, horizontally. There is very little fleshy or gelatinous
matter.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Again we see a showy species,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> making soft, spongy
patches of an orange or red-lead colour, an inch or
more in diameter, rising into ridges a quarter of an inch
high, and forming low peaks, whose apices are perforate.
Its substance contains simple needles, long, nearly or
quite straight, pointed at one end; these are found in
great numbers in close array, the points mostly projecting
from the surface. Some of them are twice as thick
as others.</p>

<p>Now we notice another peculiar form:<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> creeping,
worm-like masses of orange-yellow or buff hue, soft
and spongy in texture, which throw up one or more
free, erect processes, irregularly curved, an inch or
more long, and about one-eighth thick on an average,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
but frequently swollen and contracted by turns. These
are not tubular, and the tips are rounded. The general
surface under a magnifier appears slightly channelled.
Within we find simple needles, long, nearly straight,
pointed at both ends, moderately numerous, enveloped
in much yellow granular flesh.</p>

<p>Then there are some imposing masses of a globose
form,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> some of which attain a foot or more in diameter,
though others are not more than an inch. The surface
is compact and smooth, of a delicate purplish-grey hue,
with a few minute orifices, each surrounded by a small
paler area.</p>

<p>The spicula in this noble species are various: simple
rods, straight, thick, long, slightly spindle-shaped, blunt
at both ends, with a linear axis; three-rayed, large,
stout, very unequal angled, without any central channel;
a number of very small five- and six-rayed stars, the
rays projecting in different planes. They are set in a
dense, yellow, gelatinous flesh, in which we may at all
times discover many gemmules, or eggs; the smaller
(or younger) are nearly round, bristling with points in
all directions like sea-urchins, changing as they grow
larger to a more oval form, beset with rounded warts,
instead of points. These are discharged, when mature,
with the currents of water, through the orifices, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
find their way to some suitable spot, where they develop
themselves into the parent form.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a sort<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> whose colour is a pale Indian
red; occurring in masses which take the form of thick,
plump bands, about half-an-inch in width, but alternately
swelling and contracting, which creep over the
rock, meeting and uniting, and then separating, so as to
leave hollow open interstices, which, however, in some
specimens are gradually filled up. The swellings form
pointed hillocks, the apices of which are pierced with
from one to three orifices. Irregular shallow channels
cover the hillocks, and converge to the apices. It
contains simple needles, slender, straight (or slightly
curved), pointed at each end, not very numerous, thickly
invested with granular flesh. This Sponge shrivels
much, and becomes shapeless in drying, but changes
little in colour. It is abundant.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>Thus the praise of the all-glorious God lies latent in
all his creatures, whether man educe it or not. Too
often, when we observe the wondrous variety, the incomparable
delicacy, elegance, beauty, the transcendent
fitness and perfection of every organ and structure, we
are more occupied with our own pleasure or our own
glory than with the praise of God: our own pleasure
in acquiring new knowledge, or in admiring unexpected
beauties; our own glory in opening up new stores of
science; these are our motives to study, and we withhold
from, or feebly and grudgingly give to, the Blessed
Creator and Fashioner, the honour, of which every
atom, every combination, every exquisite contrivance,
is eloquently discoursing to us the while. Forgive, O
Thou, who hast created all things, and for whose pleasure
they are, and were created, that we so often touch with
irreverent hand Thy glorious works; that we so often
walk with silent tongues on this holy ground!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A PROTEST.</div>

<p>I cannot conclude this volume without recording my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
solemn and deliberate protest against the infidelity with
which, to a very painful extent, modern physical science
is associated. I allude not only to the ground which
the conclusions of modern geologists take, in opposition
to the veracity of the “God which cannot lie,” though
the distinct statements which He has made to us concerning
Creation are now, as if by common consent, put
aside, with silent contempt, as effete fables, unworthy
of a moment’s thought, and this too before vast assemblages
of persons, not one of whom lifts his voice for
the truth of God. These assaults are at least open and
unmasked. But there is in our scientific literature,
and specially in that which takes a popular form, a
tone equally dangerous and more insidious. It altogether
ignores the awful truths of God’s revelation, that
all mankind are guilty and condemned and spiritually
dead in Adam; that we are by nature children of
wrath; that the whole world lieth in the wicked one;
and that the wrath of God abideth on it: it ignores the
glorious facts of atonement by the precious blood of
Christ, and of acceptance in Him. It substitutes for
these a mere sentimental admiration of nature, and
teaches that the love of the beautiful makes man acceptable
to God, and secures His favour. How often do
we see quoted and be-praised, as if it were an indis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>putable
axiom, the sentiment of a poet who ought to
have known better,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
“He prayeth best who loveth best</div>
<div class="verse indent2">All things, both great and small;”&mdash;
</div></div></div>

<p>a sentiment as silly as it is unscriptural; for what connexion
can there be between the love of the inferior
creatures, and the acceptableness of a sinner praying
to the Holy God? It is the intervention of Christ
Jesus, the anointed Priest, which alone gives prayer
acceptance.</p>

<p>There is no sentimental or scientific road to heaven.
There is absolutely nothing in the study of created
things, however single, however intense, which will
admit sinful man into the presence of God, or fit him
to enjoy it. If there were, what need was there that
the glorious Son, the everlasting Word, should be made
flesh, and give His life a ransom for many?</p>

<p>If I have come to God as a guilty sinner, and have
found acceptance, and reconciliation, and sonship, in
the blood of His only-begotten Son, then I may come
down from that elevation, and study creation with
advantage and profit; but to attempt to scale heaven
with the ladder of natural history, is nothing else than
Cain’s religion; it is the presentation of the fruit of
the earth, instead of the blood of the Lamb.</p>

<p>This Work announces and illustrates a grand Physical Law, which, though hitherto
unrecognised, is proved to be of universal application in the organic world&mdash;the Law
of Prochronism in Creation. On this principle the Author shows that the conclusions
of geologists as to the great antiquity of the earth are not <i>inevitable</i>, that there is
another solution of the facts at least <i>possible</i>.</p>

<p>“We have no hesitation in pronouncing this book to be the most important and best-written
that has yet appeared on the very interesting question with which it deals.
We believe the logic of the book to be unanswerable, its postulates true, its laws fairly
deduced.”&mdash;<i>Nat. Hist. Review, Jan. 1858.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> M. Coste has lately communicated a paper to the Academy of Sciences
on the progress of his artificial oyster-beds on the western coast of France.
Several thousands of the inhabitants of the island of Ré have been for the
last four years engaged in cleansing their muddy coast of the sediments
which prevented oysters from congregating there; and as the work advances
the seed wafted over from Nieulle and other oyster localities settles in the
new beds, and, added to that transplanted, peoples the coast, so that
72,000,000 of oysters, from one to four years old, and nearly all marketable,
is the lowest average per annum registered by the local administration,
representing, at the rate of from 25 to 30 francs per thousand, which is the
current price in the locality, a sum of about two millions of francs, the
produce of an extremely limited surface. That the waves or currents
carry the seed of oysters is a well-known fact, since the walls of sluices
newly erected are often covered with them. In the island of Ré, the existence
of the oyster-beds, however, no longer depends upon this contingency,
they being now in a state of permanent self-reproduction. The distinction
of oyster-beds into those of collection and those of reproduction is quite
unnecessary, since the property of reproduction belongs to them all. In
some localities it is sufficient to prepare the emerging banks for collection
to see them soon covered with seed; but in other places nothing would be
obtained without transplanting proper subjects, an operation which by no
means impairs their reproductive qualities. The concession of emerging
banks is anxiously applied for by the inhabitants of the coast; the more so
as improvements in the working of this branch of trade are of daily occurrence.
Thus, Dr. Kemmerer, of Ré, covers a number of tiles with a coating
of a kind of mastic, brittle enough to enable him to detach the small
oysters from it. When this coating is well covered with seed he gets it off
all in one piece, which he carries to the place where the seed is to grow.
The same tile he coats a second time, and so on as long as the seed will
deposit upon it. In short, wherever the violence of the currents and the
instability of the bottom do not present irresistible obstacles the cultivation
of the oysters has become a lucrative business.</p></div>

J. E. Gray describes as new to naturalists these and other habits of the
Pipe-fishes, which he had observed when watching specimens kept in the
tanks of the gardens in Regent Park. And he takes occasion to lecture
other “persons who have leisure and opportunity” for not giving more
particulars of the manners of fishes. But the habits in question had been
described in minute detail by myself nine years before (see my <i>Devonshire
Coast</i>, p. 180, <i>et seq.</i>), together with many other interesting points in the
economy of these curious fishes. The still earlier observations of Mr.
Couch are also thus cavalierly ignored.</p></div>

communicated this species, thinks that it may have been confounded by
former observers with the preceding. “The broad specific difference
between them is that <i>L. nivea</i> has <i>very</i> large triradiate spicula at its
surface, and <i>L. Gossei</i> has not, but has in lieu of them very large acerate
ones at right angles to the surface.” (Bowerb. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in litt.</i>)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_168_168" id="Footnote_168_168"></a><a href="#FNanchor_168_168"><span class="label">[168]</span></a> I have been minute in the descriptions of these species, because the
student of marine zoology has so little to aid him in the identification of
our Sponges. This South Devon coast is peculiarly rich in these productions;
and several of these, though common here, are considered, as Dr.
Bowerbank tells me, quite rare. The figures, which I have drawn from
the life with great care, will, I trust, leave no difficulty in the identification.

<p>
Plate <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#PLATE36">XXXVI.</a></span> is devoted to the above species of Sponges. Beginning
from the upper right corner, we have <i>Halichondria panicea</i>, greenish yellow,
with perforated hillocks: it occurs also in other parts of the picture.
The scarlet one next below is <i>Grantia coriacea</i>. The black one to the
right is <i>Halina Bucklandi</i>. The plump buff one under the scarlet is <i>Halichondria
incrustans</i>. Below this is the contorted <i>Leuconia nivea</i>. Then
follows, below, and a little to the left, <i>Hymeniacidon caruncula</i>. Below
this are two specimens of <i>Leuconia Gossei</i>, and on the left, yellow, with a
slender serpent-like projection, <i>Hymeniacidon albescens</i>. Behind this is
the grey globular <i>Pachymatisma Johnstoni</i>, and below, to the left, the pale
red <i>Microciona carnosa</i>.</p></div>
